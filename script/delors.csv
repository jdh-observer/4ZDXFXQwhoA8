1,9/13/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",1,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,000 - 60,0,60,60,1,1,,EN,"First of all I should like to thank M. Lamfalussy and the BIS for having agreed to help us to run these meetings. We have to end at 17.30 in order to enable all members of the Committee to be present at the time the conclusions will be drawn before the next meeting. I shall very briefly discuss one or two things. First of all we shall formerly appoint the two rapporteurs. This is a matter that we have discussed with each member of the group and I wish to ask you to confirm your agreement to the appointment of Mr. Gunter Baer and Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa as rapporteurs. We are going to ask them to come in. They will keep the minutes of the meeting, minutes which will be kept here at the BIS, they will not be made generally available. I will put a technical question to you: would you agree to the discussions being recorded and to being kept in great secrecy here at the BIS or are you against recording? I leave the decision to you. It is obvious that the rapporteurs will note the main points, but some things may escape their attention and it would be very helpful to them if we had a tape which they could refer to, a tape which would be kept here confidentially. Would you agree to this, Mr. Governors? Thirdly, I suggest that we issue neither a press statement, nor do we hold a press conference, not even for your Chairman. A press statement might be useful but I am afraid that that would probably waste an hour and half here amongst ourselves trying to settle on such a statement, even if it were to be only fifteen lines long. Therefore we are going to work and if anybody puts any question to me I shall say that we work in a good atmosphere, that we are all aware of the mandate given us by the Heads of Government. Never are we going to give the impression that there is disagreement amongst us. We are a team, we do teamwork to serve our Masters and that is all. Were we a group of academics, doubtlessly there might be differences of opinion, but we are not going to dramatise them and we are not going to turn the meeting of this group into a series, like Dynasty or Dallas - and one that would be less attractive too. Fourthly, I should like to emphasise the highly confidential nature of our meetings.","First of all I should like to thank M.

Some temptation exists then in my opinion, in the absence of progress in those areas, for perhaps excessive emphasis to be placed by politicians on monetary and exchange rate co-operation. May I just say that I am firmly of the view that if in fact progress is to be made it has got to be parallel progress with monetary and exchange rate co-operation on the one side and economic progress on the other. I think for these reasons we need to be on our guard, therefore, against attempts to force the pace of monetary integration, particularly towards the premature blocking of parities which a union would imply. I don't say that I am against monetary integration, I am arguing about forcing the pace of it. I think the risk arises because this aspect of economic and monetary union is probably technically easier to define and to effect than economic conversions. There are therefore clear political temptations to go out for it in the hope that once it is achieved the other necessary successful elements of EMU will follow. In short, an attempt to force monetary union ahead of economic and even political union has the danger perhaps of failing, and to that extent possibly even discrediting monetary union. In these circumstances I find myself inclined towards the step-by-step approach, not the ""petit pas"", the tiny steps necessarily, they could be substantial steps, but steps they need to be even though they may be less glamorous and concentrate on steady consolidation of successive advances on all fronts instead of what one might call a dash for the grand"" concept. May I just emphasise again the importance that I attach to what I call ""parallelism"", if I can use that word to describe progress being made at roughly the same pace towards economic union as it is made towards monetary integration. I hope that those few expressions of principle, Mr. Chairman, put a slant onto Werner as I look at it now which my colleagues may find helpful.","...

1,9/13/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",15,Dr. W.F. Duisenberg ,Wim Duisenberg,508 - 594,508,594,86,1,1,,EN,"... Economic union to me is more than the internal market alone when all physical barriers have disappeared. Economic union, because monetary union affectively implies having one currency, implies also co-ordination or at least a degree of centralisation of policies in other areas, i.e. in budgetary and fiscal policy. That is part of economic union. From the outset, I agree with Leigh-Pemberton that economic and monetary union is the end phase, that is what we have to strive at, and I am not against the step-by-step approach towards that end, however long it may take. But the end should be clear in our minds, that is the first thing for us to do. ...

... The years that have passed and the experience that we have gained have clearly enhanced the chances of realising Werner after all. Weaknesses are in particular in the domain of policies where towards the end of economic and monetary union a degree of centralisation is necessary, but where it cannot be denied we have deep differences of opinion on the nature and the measure wherein there has to be a transfer of sovereignty to a centralised institution, whether it be in a federal form or completely centralised. The analysis rightly states that with the transfer of monetary authorities, the institutional arrangements have been inadequately precisely defined, and that has been a hindrance to progress in this area. For example, the FECOM is under the right of directives of the Council of Ministers and for that reason maybe the FECOM has not been the success which had been envisaged. ... 

... The co-ordination of monetary policy is also severely hindered by insufficient convergence of government finance, whether the result that too large government deficits or the ways in which they are being financed in a number of countries - my own perhaps not being excluded - are a severe hindrance for the further co-ordination of monetary policy. Identification of monetary co-ordination cannot solve this problem, then you need to go further. If you try to do that through monetary policy only, it would create interest rate differentials which could be enormous and which would create political tensions in the Community and which would be detrimental economically speaking. We all know through our experiences that monetary policy alone cannot carry the burden on its own and that budgetary policy has to give its contribution. The existing procedures of co-ordination are too free, we need more centralisation there and the transfer for sovereignty. That is the end goal to which we, I think, have to work and once we have defined that end goal I am not at all against a step-by-step approach as long as we know what we are doing and what we are working for, aiming at.

1,9/13/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",16,Mr. M. Boyer,Miguel Boyer,651 - 690,651,690,39,1,1,,EN,"... Since we are moving very quickly from the analysis of the Werner Report to an analysis of the existing situation, it seems to me that we should begin by selecting a modest approach, not a maximalistic approach but a minimalistic approach. We do not yet have enough of an impulse in respect of our ultimate objectives - single currency, European Central Bank, fixed exchange rates. What we have is a set of political decisions and from these political decisions we have to deduce monetary consequences. The liberalisation of capital movements will expose the European Monetary System to shocks which will be much greater than any shocks encountered by the system since 1979. Therefore, one has a feeling that one has to move forward, but not so much towards an objective which will give rise to political disagreement, but rather to generate a development which will be capable of ensuring that the system will at least operate as well as it has in the recent past, and that it will be capable of absorbing the shocks which will result from the liberalisation of capital movement - speculation, etc. Thus, if one wonders if one wishes to go all out for a quantum leap or whether that would be dangerous, whether a more modest approach is to be preferred, it seems to me that the latter is to be preferred - to move very modestly and carefully forward. As we do this there will be different alternatives, different concepts as to what is a minimum requirement and what, on the other hand, is perhaps not the absolute minimum requirement but something over and above that. Then one might also consider the more distant political future. It seems to me that our starting point now is not that we have to converge towards an economic and monetary union which is clearly defined, but rather to try and identify the monetary consequences of the political decisions that have already been made, i.e. liberalisation of capital movements and the single market. It is after this analysis that we will probably be able to embark on a discussion of the next stages - steps large or small - towards the ultimate goal.","...

1,9/13/1988,OK,,T,19,Herrn K.-O. Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,864 - 910,864,910,46,1,1,,EN,"... There are several points in the Werner Report which I think are still valid. One is the emphasis, which has been rightly said by previous speakers already, on parallelism. This is very important, particularly for central bankers (and I am very grateful Carlo that you said it), that we need of course, if we want to come nearer to an economic and monetary union, much closer co-operation and co-ordination, not only of monetary policies, where I think we have made more progress than in other areas, but we need that also in fiscal policy, in demand management policies and in macro-economic policies as a whole. We have enormous imbalances. in some areas, the real economy that is the real problem not the lack of credit facilities, etc. So we have to emphasise in our report (I hope that we can reach agreement on that point) what has been said already in the Werner Report, that you need progress on all levels so to say of co-ordination. That can, of course, also have institutional consequences, not only in the field of monetary policy (we are talking about the European Central Bank, etc.) but what about institutional provisions for a better co-ordination of fiscal policy, regional policies. Is it conceivable, for instance, to have a system with exchange rates which cannot be changed any more or only under very restrictive conditions without having a very developed system of what we call in German ""Finanzausgleich"" - I don't know whether there is an English word for that - transfers of financial resources. For instance, that is something I would be prepared to subscribe to in the common report in order to make the politicians and the heads of governments aware of the consequences of a more fixed exchange rate system. This is one element of the Werner Report which I think is still valid and
which we can still use.

The other one - and I think we should use that as a starting point for our report - is the definition of what we are aiming for. We need something like that, we have the final goal is before we talk about steps to get there. I fully agree with what you said, Robin, of course, we should not have any illusions, and I think none of us has any illusions about what is possible. Before we talk about the steps to come to monetary and economic union we have to know what it means and I think the Werner Report provides us with a very good definition both of the economic union and the monetary union. The definition of a monetary union is very simple but still valid: it is free movement of capital, full convertibility of currencies and irreversible fixing of exchange rates. This is a very simple definition but it has of course enormous consequences if you take it seriously. We should start with that definition and from there we can maybe find some proposals, hopefully we can make some proposals, as to how we can get a little closer to this final stage. I don't want to discuss that at this stage already.","... There are several points in the Werner Report which I think are still valid.

I think that that is no longer the case. We have a clear view of what we would like to do, clearer than we had then. We also know exactly what effort that entails, but I do know that it will be difficult to reach this aim of economic and monetary union. As I said we have to have a clear definition. From the Werner Report we know what the objective is supposed to be. It is quite clear, therefore, that we will have to take certain steps, but these steps, as Governor Ciampi said, should be steps that will allow us or even force us to take further steps forward. That brings me to the point of the timetable. It is quite clear that if we have a timetable, the timetable has to have a certain rigidity. If it is too rigid it can be counterproductive because if we cannot stick to the timetable as we had fixed it for ourselves, that means that the project which we were supposed to achieve through the timetable might be endangered as well. You have to have certain constraints, certain obligations here, because if you don't say anything as to what you want to do by when, then the whole thing becomes totally vague and it will not be implemented at all. The progress we have made in the Community so far I think has shown us that you could not always make progress everywhere at the same time, that is absolutely impossible. You cannot make the same sort of progress in the same way simultaneously with the same number of steps for all areas where you want to reach progress. I think in the Community so far we have seen that it was possible to take steps to institute mechanisms which then led us to make progress in other areas as well. If we look at all this and if we then ask ourselves what steps do we have to take in order to ensure this convergence of economic policies, we see immediately that it is a rather difficult task we have fixed ourselves. What we can do at least is to try and establish certain mechanisms which will then force us towards greater convergence in all areas of economic policy. I think that there we will probably have to follow the example of other small-step procedures. Look at the European Monetary System, that was also in a small-steps procedure perspective. Firstly, you took one small step where you had no institutional implications involved, but this first small step later on led to a greater convergence of the economic policies of the various member countries and that in itself would have been quite difficult to foresee without that first step.","...

1,9/13/1988,OK,,T,21,M. J. de Larosière,Jacques de Larosière,980 - 1063,980,1063,83,1,1,,EN,"… Therefore we ought to take into account what we have learnt in the course of our thinking, since there are respects in which we can do better than we were able to do at the time of Werner. The idea of parallelism, which has been emphasised by a number of my colleagues, is a very powerful idea. We all know that you cannot do everything in the monetary field if there are no accompanying developments in the economic field and in the fiscal field and even in respect of the incomes policy. This idea of parallelism therefore seems to me to be important. After all facts also go in the direction of parallelism. What I am trying to say is that as far as the real economy is concerned, we have made progress as compared to where we stood at the time of the Werner Report. For instance, freedom of capital movement: there we are indeed much further advanced than at Werner's time. We have nearly reached our target with a few exceptions which still have to be dealt with and some of us are going to handle them quickly. We are about to find ourselves in a system which is totally open as far as capital is concerned, and the financial economy has also developed. Our Europe today is not what it was in the 1970s. Our Europe is full of multinational corporations, banks which are fully integrated and prepared to act in an integrated market. Therefore there has been forward movement, there has been progress, and one should not it seems to me concentrate only on the failures of the Werner plan, because a great deal that is encouraging has happened.

How to proceed now. I agree with all those that said that first of all the objective had to be described. You cannot sketch out a road if you don't know where it is going to take you and I think that this objective we should not spend too much time on trying to define it because it is a relatively simple objective. As was said, the Werner Report is quite explicit as far as the objective of the economic and monetary union is concerned. One might perhaps elaborate the final scenario a little bit, but I don't think that this is going to cause many difficulties, I don't think that it is in respect of that that there are going to be differences between us, because once you are in the process which will take you towards economic and monetary union you will be taken along and there is not very much you can do really, although of course you may be more or less ambitious. What is important is the steps that will take us there and it is there that, Mr Chairman, you yourself and the co-authors of this report will prove to be very helpful. There are mistakes that were made at the time of the Werner Report which should be avoided and there are certain other things which ought to be done. What strikes me is that one was not very careful or meticulous when working out the phases through which, according to Werner, one would have to go, and one did not describe very carefully the links between these phases, the interphases between the phases, and I think that we on the contrary will have to be very towards our objective. We also have to be very realistic even if this means that we won't be very global. It was rightly said that Europe is a Europe of twelve now, it is more heterogeneous, all of us are not equally open, we do not all have the same problems in respect of the co-ordination of economic policy, we are not all in the narrow-band system and I think that when describing these various phases or various steps we shall have to allow for the plurality of circumstances which obtain within us. Then we shall have to be very very detailed as to the description of the parallelism. I would imagine the following scenario: there would be a first step in respect of monetary union and to this there would correspond another step which would aim at co-ordinating fiscal policies - this would not shock me at all, this would spread out the political responsibilities more evenly. Then the governors should as much as possible be involved and responsible for everything that will turn out to be a monetary institution. I do not believe that the EMCF scheme which is administered by governors, yes, but the governors are in a state of dependence with respect to the Council and I_don't think it has much of a future. The governors must therefore be very directly involved. I think that rather modestly at the outset, without thinking in terms of institutions, we should provide for certain steps which would result in an embryo being set up which would begin to operate and which would enable governors to do jointly a number of things, modest things at the beginning, but this embryo would be such as to grow as time passes and as progress will be made in more general terms, so that this embryo will be given more and more monetary responsibilities in respect of the management of currencies. If we do our work well we ought to be able to build up something which would be capable of growing, of developing, which might even pull progress along and encourage it.","… Therefore we ought to take into account what we have learnt in the course of our thinking, since there are respects in which we can do better than we were able to do at the time of Werner.

I would agree with Karl-Otto Pšhl that one shouldn't be too pessimistic about evaluating the Werner Report. Of course, you can say that the report was a philosophy, it failed because of bad shocks or wrong philosophies, fine-tuning, or you have this very fine argument which I think is highly dangerous that if they had been better politicians they could arrange again between decisions and the market mechanism. But God couldn't do that in paradise! I don't think that it is easy to do that and I don't think you should try to explain to the politicians that that would be a thing which we could tell them how to do. I think that there is one feature about the Werner Report and the later experience that is common, that is that you have a goal and then you think you have some instruments, either you agree on them and you have an institution where you have the instruments. Actually they proposed a European co-operation fund and it was established, but it doesn't work. The curious thing is that this was repeated in 1979/80, because the decision of Bremen and Brussels in 1978 was also to create an institution, a fund, and at that time there was a report with Werner but it was cut in half and the first part was thrown away. I think that Padoa-Schioppa was instrumental also in writing the report at that time, where you dealt with the question of the fund, but it was not established. So one has to ask the question, why has it been impossible to create these two institutions in a workable way? One can then of course come to the conclusion that an economic union has been established in spite of the failure to try to establish these things. I think we have to be very clear about the definition of an economic union and how far we have come to realising this objective.","...

Thygesen,Niels Thygesen,1299 - 1327,1299,1327,28,1,1,,EN,"Mr. Chairman, the Werner Report has been praised for stating the final objective clearly and that is well justified. I would be more complementary also on one additional point: it did define a first stage. Despite its emphasis on parallel progress in monetary and other areas, the governments also went ahead and established the SNAKE, the mechanism that kept several of the Community's currencies together in the 1970s. That was a useful learning experience and the Community would have been worse off if we had not had that inspiration from the Werner Report. Subsequently, that developed into the European Monetary System as other countries joined. There is no doubt that for a long time monetary integration, particularly now in the 1980s, has tended to run ahead of economic integration. I think it would be worrisome if we were to draw the inference from the Werner Report that progress always has to be in parallel, has to wait for the area that is most difficult. At one time it was necessary to move ahead in the monetary area, even if economic integration was not progressing. I suggest that we have today a situation where economic integration has to a large extent caught up with the monetary co-operation that we have and that therefore this group, and after all although the mandate is one of both economic and monetary union, it is a Committee largely of central bankers so it would be expected of the group that it concentrates to some extent on the monetary aspects of integration, that it considers also the possibility that monetary integration in the next phase runs a little bit ahead of economic integration in the broad sense. Governor Hoffmeyer said that if we have economic integration, an economic union, why is it necessary also to have monetary union. I think there are additional, separate benefits in monetary union if by that we understand ultimately a single currency. Some benefits can only be realised through monetary union. One might imagine economic union in a wide sense without monetary integration, but surely some benefits in terms of removal of risks, lower transaction costs, possibility of more transparent and efficient markets, are only achievable if you have full monetary integration. I hope that this Committee will in its assessment also of Werner be appreciative of the fact that at that stage one did move ahead in monetary integration.","Mr. Chairman, the Werner Report has been praised for stating the final objective clearly and that is well justified.

This question is not mentioned, it is only mentioned in the context of the Werner definition where it is said that monetary union means irreversibly fixed exchange rates and this is certainly the point of no return. We have to distinguish between a world in which exchange rates are still maybe fixed but adjustable as in the EMS, or even more or less flexible as in the case of the United Kingdom, and a world with fixed exchange rates which cannot be changed at all. In that world that would have far-reaching consequences and maybe we have to make our governments aware of these consequences at least in our report. It means, for instance, that there has to be closer, not only co-operation, but there has to be a common fiscal policy, even if it is in a federation you need some common budget, for instance. The Community budget would be much too small in such a system, you would need a much bigger budget which is not only concentrating on agricultural policy but also on many other areas of policy - infrastructure, etc. There is only one consequence: this has far-reaching consequences for wage policies, for instance. There has to be a flexible wage policy. There is no chance to have exchange rates as a buffer for divergent developments. I think there can't be different interest rates as well and so you need a common monetary policy; that is very close to a European Central Bank, but it can be conducted also in other ways of close co-operation between national central banks, but you need a common monetary policy. As long as you have exchange rates and the possibility of exchange rate changes, there is not the same degree of pressure for co-ordination. You can of course have a system in which one country puts more emphasis on growth and the other country more emphasis on price stability, because that can be corrected both by interest rate differentials and, as a last resort, by exchange rate changes. Of course, you need some convergence and there is also some pressure on convergence if it is a system like the EMS, but it is by far not the same degree of pressure which you have when you do the last steps, so to say, in fixed exchange rates.

My proposal, I think we have to be a little more practical because our time is very limited - we have only a few meetings - and we have been asked to make proposals. What I would suggest is that in our report we start with the little historical reminiscence on what M. Werner has told us and what we have achieved and what we have not achieved.

We had different views around the table as far as the programme and the way in which we want to work was concerned, but there is one comment which we all have to make. We have to see first of all where we want to go, where we want to get to. It is only once we are clear on that that we will be able in the group - and that is exactly what the Heads of State and governments are expecting from us - to ask all the institutional, economic, monetary and monetary policy questions which arise from that. What is our starting point? Do we have to define and redefine economic union? Do we have to keep the definition of monetary union? Some of you don't agree, well let us say that, let us say that we have to start from a given standard, a given norm and then we have to develop certain things which will allow us to change. I don't think that we can do without this exercise, because when we do this exercise we see what we want to state in the report. We have to discuss, however, within a certain time limit. We have to have a time horizon because otherwise the technical discussion will not be as far-reaching as it should be. During my early days I read a lot of documents on what a common space, an economic space, a financial space, etc. could be. There are differences of view here too, some people think that if you maintain major differences in the budgetary deficits this is not possible, you just cannot have these differences. In other papers we have mechanisms on how to finance them. All these questions, of course, have to be discussed in great detail and this is why my suggestion to you would be this: for the next meeting let us base ourselves on a renewed definition of economic union. As you said, let us reconfirm monetary union and its definition and on that basis let us then look at the institutional, economic, monetary, macro-economic and structural problems which arise on that basis. This work could be done in a short written statement which could be sent to you either by the rapporteurs before the next meeting or by some of you if you want to contribute something in writing. I think that this is an exercise we have to do as a basis, otherwise we cannot go into the details. After all we are amongst ourselves here. I read the report of the Giscard d'Estaing Group with great attention and great interest. There are some very good things in it but some of the questions you raised here today are not dealt with in that report at all. For example, the question of how you can fight against regional imbalances, that question is not dealt with at all. That does not mean that there will or will not be transfers, that is something which you can put as a question to students in their first year of economics, but we can have a very interesting discussion on that basis. The policies which were created and which have been implemented are not just policies of resource transfer, it is a ÒpartenariatÓ idea with the various states and the Community trying to work together and to create a productive environment. What can we learn from the United States? That the revival of certain regions stems from the fact that universities, banks, corporations got together and created a dynamic, inventive, collectively innovative environment. That is why these questions should really be discussed in great detail.

My first proposal is: for our next discussion let us have as a basis a short statement which says what we mean by economic and monetary union. Every one of us can then nuance this in the way he would like to see it. You can then distinguish between, for example, an absolute locking of parities or exchange rates which are adaptable, or exchange rates which are fixed but with certain margins. That is a discussion which we can have then as a second step. I must say quite frankly that I have not read any document which would really go into the furthest details of what an economic and monetary union as a space for Europe can be. Of course, you have further implications, for example, what transfer of sovereignty do you accept and how can you really melt these twelve countries into one unit. There are major cultural differences which have a very major influence on how you see political and economic concepts, etc. For example, in order to get the agreement of all governments, and especially the British Prime Minister, on the adaptation of the common agricultural policy, the argument which convinced her to make the first step was that we said that we have to accept the diversity in the Community. For example, ""set aside"" is something which the German farmers like, the French don't like it all, but we said OK that is the diversity with which we have to live. I think here in our area we are faced with the same problem. (The ""set aside"": where you don't cultivate certain areas, where you take them out of production.)

For next time, of course if you want to make a written statement you are welcome. The rapporteurs will try to put this into a working document and then we can discuss on that basis. On that basis we can try and discuss the major questions which will arise from an economic and monetary union. Of course there are different starting points but we have to take one so that we can start from somewhere. That is the theory. That was my first point. Secondly, even if you don't agree to this idea we still have to try and see what a European Central Bank system would be, that is also something which, within a certain time horizon, we should study. Eleven governments spoke of a common currency and a central bank so we have to look at that. We will have to see what autonomy the system would have, what aims it would have to reach, what objectives it would set itself, what instruments and tools the governing body of this central bank would have - I think these are also questions which we will have to discuss. That is enough for next time.

I just wanted to say that, at least that was the impression I had from what you said, we also have to have a certain assessment of the European Monetary System. How are we going to do this? Are we going to ask the Chairman of the Committee of Governors to do that and to see how the EMS has worked? Because I think that the EMS is just as important a basis as the Werner Report and we have to discuss this as well in our final report. Since we will be faced with the question at some stage anyway, I wonder whether one of you, maybe somebody who has studied the question in detail already, could look at the question of parallel currency. Not today and not for the next meeting but for one of the later meetings. I think for our next meeting if we could start discussing the economic and monetary union and all the problems it will give rise to and if we then ask ourselves what sort of a system we could have for a European Central Bank and how we are going to get there by rigid stages or non-rigid stages. The process which the Community has been following has been absolutely flexible and we have still made progress. Is that the same sort of procedure we want to follow for the European Central Bank as well? I think, firstly, we will also have to have an assessment of the EMS, I think in the governors Committee you have discussed this already in great detail and you should have some basis there. Mr. Thygesen has worked a lot on that, maybe he could be asked to prepare a short report on parallel currency. I would like to leave it at that. These are just suggestions, just proposals, of course they don't give you the whole working schedule and the whole mandate we have here. This is an informal document, I don't want to put it into the wastepaper basket straight away. It did point out a number of questions, but we will have to ask ourselves how we start, from what starting point, what is the first step. That is quite a good solution, but it doesn't allow us to give all the technical details to the governors and that is something that they would need. This is why I said let us start with this set of rules. Some of you will not agree to all of these rules, some of you will put forward reservations, some of you will want certain things nuanced first. At least that is a starting point and at least in this way we can study certain things which haven't been studied yet or which have just led to a polemic discussion between people who say, well we want economic and monetary union and other people who say we want just economic union, and others who say that they want to have this major European space.","...

... En ce qui concerne tout d'abord les problèmes, si je peux garder la parole dix minutes pour cela. Pour que les forces intellectuelles soient absolument productives il faut partir d'hypothèses a priori. L'hypothèse c'est celle des changes fixes, si on ne prend pas cette hypothèse, alors on a constamment en tête plusieurs chemins et ce n'est pas clair. Autrement dit, le taux de change ne peut plus être utilisé dans cette hypothèse comme un instrument d'ajustement de l'économie. ? comme le dit le Président Pöhl dans son document, la nécessité d'une coordination plus stricte des politiques économiques. Bien entendu certains entre vous voudront peut-être au départ de la discussion, dans ce premier tiers de la discussion, soutenir une hypothèse contraire. Mais, par exemple, en évoquant l'expérience du système monétaire européen, même s'il y a eu des réajustements dans ce système, mais enfin c'est déjà un beau sujet de théorie économique de se demander si les ajustements des taux de changes ? les instruments appropriés pour adapter des économies. Jusqu'à présent, et pour que notre discussion ne s'égare pas, nous avons postulé qu'il n'a l'été pas et que l'union économique et monétaire postulait des taux de changes fixes. Vous me permettrez d'insister sur ce point, même si ensuite certains entre vous - et nous trouverons un moment dans la discussion - voudront soutenir une thèse contraire. Mais enfin la discussion de la dernière fois, la manière dont vous avez confirmé en ce qui concerne la définition, au moins le Rapport Werner, même si vous avez assorti ensuite de commentaires sur le caractère plus ou moins réaliste de ce rapport a l'époque où il a été fait, même si vous avez insisté sur ce qui a été fait depuis, vous n'avez pas remis en cause ce point. A partir de cette notion-là, c'est à dire l'hypothèse de changes fixes, il me semble qu'il y a trois questions qui se posent.

1. La stabilité des changes fixes implique une contrainte de convergence des économies - oui, mais quel modèle? Quand je dis quel modèle il ne s'agit pas de remettre en cause l'hypothèse de la stabilité des prix, celle-ci elle est également acquise. Enfin il y a plusieurs modèles économiques en présence actuellement dans la Communauté. Quand je dis plusieurs modèles économiques je ne les situe pas sur un échelon de vertu, mais sur les conceptions que les uns ou les autres ont. Il faut en parler, car si on n'en parle pas les chefs d'état et les gouvernements auront un dialogue dessus.

2. Il faut des politiques d'accompagnement et de transferts pour réaliser cette convergence des économies. La il y a des conceptions différentes. Il y a une conception minimale et une conception maximale. Je voudrais quand même dire que pour ceux qui prétendent ou qui démontrent qu'on ne peut pas avoir de convergence sans une extrême centralisation des politiques économiques et une harmonisation très poussée des fondements de cette économie que les chefs de gouvernement ont une thèse contraire dans l'ensemble. Ils considèrent que s'il faut transférer des pouvoirs à une institution centrale, que j'appellerais l'institution X, au niveau communautaire, en revanche dans une structure fédérale comprise il faut l'essentiel la politique macro-économique reste entre les mains des états, alors entre ceux qui veulent tout centraliser au niveau européen et ceux qui ont des réticences à lâcher des pouvoirs il y a tout un arc-en-ciel de positions possible. Il n'y en a pas qu'une. Je crois que quelque soit l'opinion que vous avez sur ça, notre intérêt serait de définir un minimum, dans la sens que les chefs d'état et des gouvernements se rendent compte de ce que cela présente. Parmi ces éléments il y en a un qui a fait l'objet de discussions depuis longtemps à propos de l'union monétaire: c'est quelle est la taille minimale d'un budget communautaire, et quels sont les transferts qui doivent étre fait, le montant des transferts? Il n'y a pas que la taille minimum du budget communautaire et la taille des transferts, il y a aussi - et cela est passée à peu près inaperçu - que les politiques d'accompagnement telles que les a définies la Commission Européenne et les a présentées dans le paquet de Bruxelles qui a été adopté, ces politiques d'accompagnement ne sont pas des politiques de simple transferts financiers, elles sont des politiques qui impliquent une nette technique et un partenariat entre la Communauté, la nation et la région. Peut-être avons-nous eu tort de proposer cela, mais c'est un fait. C'est cette tentative qui va être faite. Autrement dit, dans la conception actuelle qu’à la Commission des politiques d'accompagnement, celles-ci vont au-delà du transfert financier, puisqu'elles vont au-delà nécessite moins de transferts financiers, mais plus de coordination, plus d'appui technique, et dans le fond donnent une certaine importance aux effets de diffusion du grand marché.

3. Beaucoup de théoriciens qui ont écrit sur l’union économique ne voient que les handicaps des régions défavorisées, mais est-ce-qu'on ne peut pas aussi parler des attraits des régions défavorisées, pour attirer les investissements ou comme base de compétitivité? Qu'y a-t-il de plus important quand on décide une localisation d'une activité productrice? Est-ce-que c'est l'environnement général de cette activité, qui bien entendu est meilleur dans les pays les plus avancés? Ou bien est-ce que c'est les coûts de production, la flexibilité de la main d'oeuvre et autre? D'après tout ce que j'ai vu, il me semblerait que des régions ? défavorisées n'ont que des handicaps. Comment concilier ces handicaps avec le fait que le montant des investissements tiré, par exemple en Espagne, a été considérable ces deux dernières années?

Voila les trois questions qu'il me paraît se poser. Une contrainte de convergence, oui, mais à quel modéle? La nécessité de politique d'accompagnement de transferts, leur taille et leur conception? Enfin quelles sont les inconvénients et les avantages des régions ? défavorisées?

Ensuite l'union économique, les politiques. Comme je vous ai dit tout à I'heure, je vous propose d'écarter l'hypothèse de l'intégration parfaite. On doit l'écarter pour un instant de raison et de réflexion, car les internationaux ne vont pas ni demain ni après-demain abandonner toute leur politique économique et sociale à l'institution communautaire - ce qui ne veut d'ailleurs pas dire, bien sûr, que les contraintes de l'inconvergence n'assureront pas de plus en plus les options et orientations nationales. Donc l'hypothèse la plus rassembleuse c'est avec celle sur laquelle à mon humble avis on devait travailler c'est celle de l'intégration progressive. C'est à dire la recherche d'un ? minimum de convergence ex ante des économies et de politique appropriée. J'insiste bien convergence ex ante. Ca veut dire que l'instance X serait chargée de cela, définirait a priori les orientations valables et pour les politiques appropriées. Comme l'indique le Président Pöhl dans son papier on ne peut pas se concentrer uniquement, comme on le fait trop souvent, sur la politique budgétaire quelle que soit son importance. L'importance de la politique budgétaire tant du côté des ressources et donc de la structure des impôts et cotisations sociales que du côté des dépenses. Mais vous savez cette question, soit dit entre parenthèses, s'est déjà posée lorsque la Commission a proposé la réalisation d'un grand marché sans entraves. Fallait-il poser comme préalable l'harmonisation des systèmes fiscaux et para-fiscaux? La réponse c'était non, car si on avait voulu faire cela, il n'y aura pas aujourd'hui un Comité ad hoc pour l'union économique et monétaire, puisque l'Europe se serait assoupie ou aurait continué son sommeil. Ceci a créé un processus de déséquilibre qu’il appartient de corriger peu à peu, on sait des problèmes redoutables que la Communauté va avoir après ? prochaine en matière de TVA et d'axis et en matière de fiscalité et du revenu des capitaux mobiliers. Pour l'instant nous sommes quasiment dans un état de pré crise de la construction européenne sur ce point. Les enfants (?) ne peuvent pas prendre une intégration parfaite, on est sur cette intégration progressive. Quelles sont les politiques appropriées, quels sont les éléments et paramètres de ces politiques? Je ne fait que les citer, je suis effrayé du fait que les questions sont trop nombreuses. Tout d'abord il y a le grand marché sans entrave et ses effets d'intégration et de convergence, il ne faut pas les négliger. C'est sans doute même le phénomène le plus important. La perspective du grand marché et les réalisations déjà faites, introduisent un processus d'adaptation des économies nationales, et aussi un élément de convergence. De ce point de vue il faut souligner, je le dit en passant l'importance de la politique de la concurrence et aussi de la politique économique extérieure commune, dont parle le Président Pöhl, et qui est aussi un des grands sujets explosifs de la Communauté pour l'an prochain.

Deuxième élément: les structures des impôts et des  cotisations sociales. Leur influence est complexe sur l'offre et sur la demande. J'aurais tendance à penser que la réflexion doit porter dans ce Comité sur le rapprochement prévisible des structures et des pondérations dans les systèmes de prélèvement fiscaux et parafiscaux. Nous n'avons pas à discuter ici de la TVA, des axis, de l'impôts sur l’ordure des capitaux mobiliers. Il me semble que d'un point de vue théorique l'union économique pose la question de savoir s'il n'y aura pas sur une période longue un rapprochement des structures générales, c'est à dire de la répartition des prélèvements entre les impôts sur les entreprises, les impôts directs sur les personnes physiques, les impôts sur la consommation, les impôts sur le capital et les modes de financement de la sécurité sociale. La question qui nous est posée c'est de savoir si nous devons traiter de cette question et considérer que cela faciliterait une union économique.

Troisième question difficile: la question des déficits budgétaires nationaux. Si c'est difficile de subsister dans l'union économique, d'abord parce qu'il subsistait et comment serait-il financé? Ce qui conduit tout naturellement à une quatrième question: le budget communautaire, sa taille et ses fonctions. Cinquièmement, le rapprochement des coûts de production. Dans cette perspective on ne doit pas se focaliser sur les coûts salariaux, directs et indirects. Mais il faut aussi parler de l'efficacité du capital et du coût des avantages externes des économies.

Donc pour être simple je dirais qu'à mon sens il ne faut pas sous-estimer les effets du grand marché, il faut se poser une question sur la structure des impôts et des cotisations sociales pour faciliter une union économique, et ensuite se concentrer sur les questions budgétaires et sur les problèmes des coûts de productions. Enfin troisième question dont il faudrait dire un mot aujourd'hui me semble-t-il, l'union européenne, la question institutionnelle, en étant très schématique on pourrait dire que l'union économique et monétaire c'est une institution X qui est chargée de faire fonctionner l'union économique, et c'est une institution Y qui est chargée de faire fonctionner l'union monétaire. Institution Y se situe au sein de ce que l'on a appelé d'une manière très générale, pour ne pas préjuger les positions des uns et des autres, un système européen de banques centrales. L' institution X, elle peut résulter de différentes ? figures, mais du moment qu'elle est bien distincte de l'institution Y, et que jusqu'à présent cette institution Y nous l'avons définie comme autonome, indépendante des autres pouvoirs, ayant pour objectif la stabilité des prix, la stabilité monétaire, ayant des moyens de réguler l'ensemble du système, je propose que l'on ne reprenne pas une discussion sur les méfiances que pourrait avoir les gouverneurs de banques centrales à l'égard de l'institution X, nous perdons notre temps. Cette institution X elle peut prendre différentes formes, c'est à nous d'en discuter, c'est à nous de savoir si le Conseil Européen, lorsque le moment sera venu, décidera soit d’une augmentation des pouvoirs de la Commission Européenne, soit l'institution d'un conseil quasi permanent des ministres au niveau européen. Tout à ? il faut qu'il y ait une institution X qui se réunit, qui ex ante fasse le cadrage des politiques économiques, les évalue chaque année, et ait plus de pouvoir que le Conseil des ministres de l'économie et des finances n'en a actuellement. C'est pas la peine que j'en discute pour l'instant, peut-être certains entre vous ont des idées sur cela et y réfléchiront plus que moi.

Voilà cher collègues ce que je voulais vous dire pour introduire la discussion, non pas pour la limiter mais pour au moins éviter que nous nous égarions sur deux chemins qui ne sont pas notre propos d'aujourd'hui. Notre propos n'est pas de parler de l'union monétaire, sauf comme référence de l'union économique, et notre propos n'est pas de parler des relations dialectiques entre l'union économique et l'union monétaire, ça nous en parlerons plus tard. Je vous rappelle la question que vous avez souvent discuté même de manière indirecte que vous avez ?, savoir si une union monétaire peut encourager une union économique, ou si une union monétaire ne peut être que le produit d'une union économique, je vous en prie nous n’en discutons pas aujourd'hui, sinon nous n'arriverons pas à discuter pour une fois, d'une manière assez théorique de ce que peut être une union économique, de ce que sont ses problèmes, de ce que pourraient être les politiques communes, le minimum de politique commune et ses institutions.","
... As for the first problem, if I can keep the word ten minutes for this. For the intellectual forces are absolutely productive requires using assumptions a priori. The assumption is that fixed exchange rates, if we do not take this hypothesis, so we constantly have in mind several ways and it is not clear. In other words, the exchange rate can no longer be used in this case as an adjustment of the economy instrument. ? as the President said Pöhl in its document, the need for tighter coordination of economic policies. Of course some of you may want to start the discussion in this first third of the discussion, support a contrary hypothesis. But, for example, citing the experience of the European monetary system, even if there were readjustments in this system, but then that is already a good subject of economic theory to consider whether the exchange rate adjustments ? appropriate instruments to adapt savings. So far, and that our discussion does not stray, we postulated that has not been the economic and monetary union and postulated of fixed exchange rates. Allow me to insist on this point, although then some of you - and we will find a moment in the debate - want to support a contrary view. But after discussing the last time, how you confirmed with regard to the definition, at least the Werner Report, even if you then with comments on the more or less realistic to the time this report where it was made, even if you have emphasized what has been done, you do not have questioned that. From this concept there, ie the assumption of fixed exchange rates, seems to me that there are three issues.

1. The stability of the fixed exchange rate implies a convergence constraint money - yes, but what model? When I say what model it is not to question the assumption of price stability, it is also acquired. Finally there are several economic models currently present in the Community. When I say I several economic models does not lie on the under level but on designs that have one or the other. We have to talk, because if you do not speak the heads of state and governments will have a dialogue on.

2. We need support policies and transfers to achieve this convergence of economies. The there are different designs. There is a minimal design and maximum design. I would still say to those who claim or demonstrate that you can not have convergence without extreme centralization of economic policies and a very extensive harmonization of the foundations of this economy that government leaders have a contrary view in 'together. They consider whether to transfer powers to a central institution, I would call the institution X at Community level, however in a federal structure must understood the essential macroeconomic policy remains in the hands of states, so between those who want to centralize everything at European level and those who are reluctant to let go of power there is a whole rainbow sky possible positions. There is not just one. I believe that whatever opinion you have on that, our interest would be to define a minimum in the sense that the heads of state and governments are realizing that this presents. Among these there is one that has been discussed for a long time about the monetary union: it is what is the minimum size of the EU budget, and what are those which require to be done, the amount of transfers? It's not just the minimum size of the EU budget and the size of the transfers, it is also - and this is passed almost unnoticed - as the accompanying policies as defined in the European Commission and the presented in Brussels package that was adopted, these support policies are not simple financial transfers policies are policies that involve significant technical and partnership between the Community, the nation and the region. Perhaps we have been wrong to suggest that, but it's a fact. It is this attempt will be made. In other words, in the current design and the accompanying policies of the Commission, they go beyond the financial transfer, since they go beyond requires less financial transfers, but more coordination, more technical support, and in the background give some importance to the scattering effects of the large market.

3. Many theorists have written about the economic union only see the handicaps of the disadvantaged regions, but is it-you can not also mention the attractions of disadvantaged regions, to attract investments or as core competitiveness ? What is he more important when deciding the location of a productive activity? Do-it's the general environment of this activity, which of course is the best in the most advanced countries? Or is what is the cost of production, the flexibility of labor and other? From everything I've seen, it seems to me that the regions? poor have only disabilities. How to reconcile these handicaps with the fact that the amount of investment fired, for example in Spain, has been significant in the last two years?

These are the three issues that I think it arise. A convergence of coercion, yes, but at what model? The need for policy to support transfer, size and design? Finally what are the disadvantages and advantages of the regions? disadvantaged?

Then the economic union, political. As I just said I'heure I offers to dismiss the hypothesis of perfect integration. We must dismiss for a moment of reason and reflection, because international will not nor tomorrow nor the day after tomorrow to abandon all their economic and social policy at the Community institution - which also not mean, though sure, the constraints of inconvergence will not provide more national options and directions. So the most unifying hypothesis it is with the one on which IMHO it should work is that of the gradual integration. This means looking for? minimum of ex-ante economic convergence and appropriate policy. I stress convergence ex ante. That means the instance X would be responsible for this, define a priori valuable guidance and appropriate policies. As the President Pöhl in his paper can not just focus, as is done too often on fiscal policy regardless of its importance. The importance of fiscal policy both on resources and therefore the structure of taxes and social contributions on the expenditure side. But you know this, either parenthetically, has already asked when the Commission proposed the implementation of a large market without barriers. Should we ask as a preliminary harmonization of tax systems and para-tax? The answer was no, because if we had wanted to do this, there will not be today an ad hoc for the Economic and Monetary Union Committee, since Europe would have continued dozing or sleeping. This created an imbalance that process belongs to correct little by little we know of the formidable problems that the Community will be after? next on VAT and axis and on taxation and income from movable capital. For now we are almost in a state of pre crisis of European construction on this. Children (?) Can not make a perfect integration, it is this gradual integration. What are appropriate policies, what are the elements and parameters of these policies? I only mention, I'm scared that the questions are too many. First there is the big market unhindered and its integration and convergence effects, so do not neglect them. It's probably even the most important phenomenon. The prospect of the single market and the achievements already made, introduce a process of adaptation of national economies, and also a focal element. From this point of view it must be stressed, I incidentally the importance of competition policy and also the common external economic policy, mentioned the President Pöhl, and is also a major flash points of the Community for next year.

Second element: the structure of taxes and social contributions. Their influence is complex supply and demand. I would think that thinking must be in this committee on reconciliation predictable structures and weights in tax collection systems and quasi. We are not talking here of VAT, the axis of the taxes on junk from movable capital. I think from a theoretical point of view the economic union raises the question of whether there will not be a long period of rapprochement general structures, ie the distribution of samples between business taxes, direct taxes on individuals, consumption taxes, capital taxes and social security financing. The question we asked is that is if we deal with this issue and consider that this would facilitate an economic union.

Third difficult question: the question of national budget deficits. If it is difficult to survive in the economic union, first because it existed and how would it be funded? This naturally leads to a fourth question: the Community budget, its size and its functions. Fifth, the approximation of production costs. In this perspective one should not focus on labor costs, direct and indirect. But we must also talk about capital efficiency and cost advantages of external economies.

So for simplicity I would say that in my opinion should not underestimate the effects of the large market, we need to ask a question about the structure of taxes and social contributions to facilitate an economic union, and then focus on budgetary issues and the problems of the production costs. Finally third question that should say a word to me today it seems, the European Union, the institutional issue, being very schematic we could say that the economic and monetary union is an institution that is X responsible for operating the economic union, and Y is an institution which is responsible for operating the monetary union. Institution Y is located in what is called a very general way, not to prejudge the positions one and the other, a European system of central banks. The institution X, it can result from different? figures, but the moment it is quite distinct from the institution Y, and so far this institution Are we defined as autonomous, independent of other authorities, with the objective of price stability, monetary stability , having means to control the entire system, I suggest that we not resume a discussion of mistrust that could have the governors of central banks with regard to the X institution, we are wasting our time. This institution X can take different forms, it is for us to discuss, it is for us whether the European Council, when the time comes, will decide whether to increase the powers of the European Commission, is the establishment of a council almost permanent ministers at European level. All? there needs to be an institution that meets X, who ex ante make the framing of economic policies, the rates each year and has more power than the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers has not currently. It's not worth that I talk for now, maybe some of you have any ideas on this and will think more than me.

That dear colleagues what I meant to introduce the discussion, not to limit it but at least we prevent égarions two roads that are not our subject today. Our intention is not to speak of the monetary union, except as reference the economic union, and our intention is not to speak of the dialectical relationship between economic union and monetary union, that we'll talk later. I remind you the question you often discussed even indirectly you?, Whether a monetary union may encourage an economic union, or a monetary union can only be the product of an economic union, I will pray we will not discuss today, otherwise we will not get to talk for once, a rather theoretical way of what may be an economic union, what are their problems, what could be common policies, the minimum common policy and institutions."

Doyle,921 - 1168,921,1168,247,1,1,,EN,"I thought at the outset that I was going to have some definition of the problems with the framework of discussion that you had laid down when you said that we ought to start from the assumption of fixed exchange rates and proceed from there. It seemed to develop after a while that the definition of fixed exchange rates was a kind of Irish definition which meant what it meant until somebody wanted to change it, and then one would change the definition. But I have to say, maybe I am a non-typical Irishman, I have a great deal of sympathy for President Pöhl's definition and Mr. Duisenberg that fixed means fixed and irrevocable means irrevocable, not until somebody wants to revoke it. Given that starting point, which is a difficult one I think - since to my way of thinking it puts the cart before the horse - there is I think a considerable amount of agreement, nevertheless, around the table on what the outcome of that is and I think we only have to look at the histories of our own individual countries, both separately and collectively, to see what the effects are. They are precisely the effects that regional economic policy would lead you to expect, namely, as Mr. Lamfalussy has said, a slow, perhaps even imperceptible, transfer of economic activity from the peripheral regions to the centre, but a continuing one nevertheless. This leads me to make just two or three points about this whole discussion.

I think one important thing that we have to bear in mind is that when considering the framework of an economic and monetary union, it falls naturally enough into two separate components: an economic union and a monetary union. One can argue about which should come first - I have a very clear view in my own mind on that but it is irrelevant for the moment. The thing that tends to get overlooked in this discussion is that much of the acquiescence and approval of the operation of market forces in solving the problems that emerge starts from the premise, which is unspoken, that the different sub-sectors of the total entity - the different national economies in this case - are roughly on an equal plan at the starting point, that you are talking about economic structures which are comparable, income differences which are perhaps not too wide, levels of technical training, education, fiscal infra-structure even, which are in a broad band, and therefore in that kind of vein, of course, market forces will solve 90% of the problems and what is left can be coped with. My difficulty is that that isn't the starting point that we are looking at, we are looking at a starting point where there are widely differing levels of incomes, social structures, economic structures, industrial structures, education, training, infra-structure, etc. and the real problem, therefore, is how do you get from A to B?. When you get to B the thing becomes much more manageable. I have to say that our experience of the transfer mechanism as it has taken place so far in the EEC has not even begun to cope with this problem. An observable fact is that, for instance, income differentials have widened over the last 10 years within the Community, not narrowed. I think that my definition of the problem really is that the economic and monetary union that we are aiming for has to be one which gives the same, or roughly the same, prospects of income and employment in the peripheral regions as obtained in the central regions, otherwise it isn't an economic and monetary union. Mr. Boyer I think put a finger on that at one stage when he said that growth in the Community as a whole has to be enough to avoid disparages in income otherwise the system simply would not work.

This leads me to remark on a point that Mr. Thygesen made. I agree with practically everything he said except one thing where I differ completely with him. He said that, if I heard him right, that regional problems within member states are not due to fixed exchange rates within those members states and that nobody is suggesting that one breaks up these countries to have different exchange rates in order to solve these problems. I don't think I could agree with either half of that statement, though maybe for different reasons. I think if you look at France, for instance, there are many large towns within France which 100 or 150 years ago were on a roughly competitive level with Paris, but over that period there has imperceptibly a kind, in relative terms, and the basic economic reason is that they are operating under the same exchange rate. I am not saying that if you had different exchange rates for Paris, on the one hand, versus Lyon or Toulouse on the other, that you would now have equality of incomes, there are different factors involved, but that is certainly economically - I haven't the slightest doubt about it - one of the major factors. I have equally no doubt that if you could organise an intelligently phrased question in a referendum, which of course brings us a lot of problems, and asked the inhabitants of Montana or Wyoming whether their economic future would be improved by having a separate exchange rate from Texas, or the rest of the United States for that matter, I think I know what the answer would be. It certainly wouldn't solve the problems but it would help, or could be made to help. Therefore, I think one may be misled by following that line of thought too closely. I worry about the line of thought that there is if you can only lock all the exchange rates, for instance, together and you can think of this in parallel on a national plan and on a multinational plan. That would solve definitionally a lot of the problems. You can solve a lot of the monetary problems, a lot of the inflation problems; you don't solve the income problems, above all you don't solve the employment problems, and you don't solve the transfer of factors problems.

This leads me to transfers. There is a kind of body of thought around the table which follows on from this set of problems, which says that: all right, locking the exchange rates irrevocably doesn't solve the income and employment problems; but really what you need to solve those are (a) reductions in real wage rates, on the one hand, and (b) transfers on the other. With a judicious combination of these you can, if not solve the problems, certainly ameliorate them. I must say I have considerable qualifications about that. On the real wage rate issue, for instance, I accept that economic theory tells us that this has to be one of the adjustment mechanisms involved, if you remove the basic adjustment mechanism of changes in the exchange rate then changes in factor prices are the next logical step. Perhaps there is from our own experience we have a long history of lower real wage rates than the rest of Europe. But that has not in itself produced a transfer of capital to match the real wage rates, which in conjunction with the lower real wage rates will produce the economic results desired. That leads me to my qualification about transfers, because transfers of themselves are not going to meet these problems; at least transfers in the sense that they have been discussed until now. I am sure that everybody around this table in his own country would be the first to say you cannot solve problems simply by throwing money at them. I think that is the basic truth that one has to latch onto here. You cannot solve the problems I have been discussing either on an international basis by throwing money at them either. Therefore transfers which simply take the form of subsidies are not the answer, because all that does is give a current cost subsidy but leaves the problem intact. The transfers that are required are transfers which create the conditions in the regions, in the peripheral regions, where they themselves can come abreast of the rest of the Community. There is not a question of solving these problems by transferring funds - that I am absolutely clear about. They have to be transfers which raise the standards of the infra-structure in these regions, which compensate in that way for the cost penalties to which they are subject by distance alone, etc.; you have to raise the standards of communications, education, training, etc.

On the real wage issue I would add this qualification also: that our experience is that if you carry the question of reducing real wages in relative terms past a certain point - and the point as Robert Leigh-Pemberton really was indicating a while back may not be all that far. The pattern itself becomes a push factor in creating migration from the area in question. It is not necessarily a solution to the income and production problem in that area, it can actually make the problem worse once the relative difference in wages passes a certain noticeable point. I think that is really all I wanted to say at this stage.","I thought at the outset that I was going to have some definition of the problems with the framework of discussion that you had laid down when you said that we ought to start from the assumption of fixed exchange rates and proceed from there.

You can solve a lot of the monetary problems, a lot of the inflation problems; you don't solve the income problems, above all you don't solve the employment problems, and you don't solve the transfer of factors problems.

This leads me to transfers. There is a kind of body of thought around the table which follows on from this set of problems, which says that: all right, locking the exchange rates irrevocably doesn't solve the income and employment problems; but really what you need to solve those are (a) reductions in real wage rates, on the one hand, and (b) transfers on the other. With a judicious combination of these you can, if not solve the problems, certainly ameliorate them. I must say I have considerable qualifications about that. On the real wage rate issue, for instance, I accept that economic theory tells us that this has to be one of the adjustment mechanisms involved, if you remove the basic adjustment mechanism of changes in the exchange rate then changes in factor prices are the next logical step. Perhaps there is from our own experience we have a long history of lower real wage rates than the rest of Europe. But that has not in itself produced a transfer of capital to match the real wage rates, which in conjunction with the lower real wage rates will produce the economic results desired. That leads me to my qualification about transfers, because transfers of themselves are not going to meet these problems; at least transfers in the sense that they have been discussed until now. I am sure that everybody around this table in his own country would be the first to say you cannot solve problems simply by throwing money at them. I think that is the basic truth that one has to latch onto here. You cannot solve the problems I have been discussing either on an international basis by throwing money at them either. Therefore transfers which simply take the form of subsidies are not the answer, because all that does is give a current cost subsidy but leaves the problem intact. The transfers that are required are transfers which create the conditions in the regions, in the peripheral regions, where they themselves can come abreast of the rest of the Community. There is not a question of solving these problems by transferring funds - that I am absolutely clear about. They have to be transfers which raise the standards of the infra-structure in these regions, which compensate in that way for the cost penalties to which they are subject by distance alone, etc.; you have to raise the standards of communications, education, training, etc.

On the real wage issue I would add this qualification also: that our experience is that if you carry the question of reducing real wages in relative terms past a certain point - and the point as Robert Leigh-Pemberton really was indicating a while back may not be all that far. The pattern itself becomes a push factor in creating migration from the area in question. It is not necessarily a solution to the income and production problem in that area, it can actually make the problem worse once the relative difference in wages passes a certain noticeable point. I think that is really all I wanted to say at this stage."

I think, if I understood you and Mr. Boyer correctly, you said that it would be desirable to get less wage differentials and an equal level of income, at least as a final objective. I am not sure whether this is really a reasonable policy objective. In my country, for instance, we have that in our Constitution that that has to be maintained, you have to have the same standard of living in all regions. It is in the Constitution and I think it is a big mistake because we would rather like to have an exchange rate between Schleswig-Holstein and let's say the state of Hessen (with Frankfurt in the middle) - that would solve some of our problems, maybe not all, like Montana and New York. It would solve some of our problems, but since we don't have this exchange rate it would at least be desirable to have lower wages in Kiel than in Frankfurt, but unfortunately we have the system in Germany of nationwide wage settlements, which means in fact that a man in Kiel gets the same salary or wage as in Frankfurt. In the case of the Bundesbank, for instance, I can never ask somebody from Kiel to come to Frankfurt and accept the same job because the cost of living in Frankfurt  is 40% higher than in Kiel and so he has a much higher standard of living in Kiel. The result is that the unemployment in northern Germany is much higher than in Frankfurt or in Stuttgart. In other words, I think that lower wages in developing areas so to say are a reasonable advantage and it would be a mistake to abolish the differences as long as there are no other buffers to deal with that problem.

Just elaborating on that a little more, using a little ?, you assume you have a system with fixed exchange rates, with a proven monetary policy, some kind of harmonisation of budgetary policies, etc. then the market forces in fact would do the rest more or less, but they have to be allowed to do the rest. If you abolish the market forces by too much, for instance, regional transfers of funds, etc., I don't think the risk is very good, it would be too much. If it would be too much it would be an obstacle for the market forces to work and it would not lead, for instance, to more investment flows to countries like Ireland. If the wages in Dublin would be the same as in Paris, nobody would really be interested in investing in Dublin and Dublin's unemployment would go up.","Only a very brief remark, but I am tempted by what has been said repeatedly now on the question of wages and wage differentials in a region without exchange rates.

Sur ce point notre occupation n'était pas que des différences de salaires se maintiennent entre les pays de la Communauté mais justement que les différences ne soient pas suffisantes pour produire un taux de croissance des régions moins développées. Je crains que la rigidité salariale dans nos pays ne va pas disparaître d'aussi tôt et le cas de l'Espagne est un cas absolument contre ? en ce sens. Nous avons eu des taux de chômage extrêmement élevés avec des croissances salariales qui ont été les plus élevées des pays de l'OCDE pendant les années 1970 et début 1980. Donc notre occupation est que les différences de salaires ne vont pas peut-être compenser les différences de productivité et ne vont pas créer automatiquement un mouvement de croissance qui serait désirable ou revenait sa ? dans la mesure où la productivité s'accroît dans chaque pays. Finalement les différences se réduisent parce qu'il y a un processus de croissance de la productivité et du PIB. Done ce n'est pas tellement la préoccupation du Gouverneur Doyle, qu'il ne suffit pas des différences salariales pour créer le développement d'une région, je pense que si les différences étaient suffisantes et certaines autres choses, on pourrait évidemment obtenir le développement des régions sous-développées. Mais je crains qu'il se peut que les différences salariales ne soient pas suffisantes pour créer ce mouvement; c’est un cas classique et il faut très probablement jouer sur les taux de changes aussi.

Le deuxième point est sur le point d'être ?. Là je pense que nous avons des idées moins claires, si vous me permettez, que dans les conséquences d'une union monétaire économique totale. Je pense qu'il n'est pas très difficile, et plusieurs collègues l’ont fait, de développer la perte d'autonomie des politiques monétaires, la nécessité d'un système central et même la petite marge d'autonomie des politiques budgétaires. C'est assez facile de développer ces points dans une union monétaire complète et économique. Nous n'avons pas beaucoup développer la question des transferts régionaux. On peut se poser deux problèmes. L'un: les transferts admissibles dans la Communauté, dans le structure, vont être bien moins ? que les transferts intra-nationaux dans les années passées. Par exemple, on ne va pas accepter des ? d'entreprises, ce qui a été une partie de la politique de transferts intra-nationaux. Les transferts ne pourront peut-être pas probablement être faits pour créer des entreprises publiques, non seulement parce que cela serait aussi discutable du point de vue de la concurrence et peu acceptable, mais parce que la mode n'est pas à la création de grandes entreprises nationales d'état. Donc les transferts vont être réduit dans leurs fins et il y aura peut-être des transferts pour maintenir un revenu minimal dans l'agriculture ou ailleurs, ce qui ne va pas créer par soi-même une croissance ?, mais va maintenir la situation et je pense qu'il ne restera que des transferts d'infrastructure et des formations professionnelles. Cela va être suffisante pour des ? mouvements de croissances dans les régions sous-développées et l'expérience passée de la politique régionale dans la Communauté n'est pas une expérience qui soit un grand succès. Si la portée des transferts se réduit encore dans les endroits où elle va, on peut craindre que c'est un ? mais ce n'est pas très utile pour réduire les différences intra-nationales.

Deuxième point dont on n'a pas une idée très claire, et je pense qu'il est très difficile de l'avoir: le volume de transferts qui serait requis pour déclencher ce processus une fois qu'on n'a pas le mécanisme des taux de changes. Ca va être un volume immense et là on avait ce matin soulevé: est-ce-que les citoyens des pays riches vont accepter des transferts d'un tel volume alors qu'ils les acceptent de moins à moins satisfaits pour des transferts dans leur propre pays? Est-ce que les volumes requis, dont nous n'avons pas une idée, vont être acceptables entre les régions riches et les régions pauvres? Je pense que peut-être le point où nous sommes le moins avancé pour étudier les conséquences et les équilibres nécessaires d'une union économique et monétaire très poussée sont les aspects de politique régionale, tandis que les aspects monétaires ou budgétaires me paraissent plus simple à développer.","
On this point our occupation was not that wage differences remain between the countries of the Commonwealth but precisely the differences are not sufficient to produce a growth rate of less developed regions. I fear that wage rigidity in our countries will not disappear as early and the case of Spain is absolutely a case against? in this direction. We had extremely high levels of unemployment with wage growth were the highest in OECD countries during the 1970s and early 1980. So our occupation is that differences in wages are not going perhaps compensate differences in productivity and will not automatically create a growing movement that is desirable or returning her? since productivity increases in each country. Finally the differences are reduced because there is a process of growth of productivity and GDP. Done this is not so much the concern of Governor Doyle, it is not enough wage differences to create the development of a region, I think that if the differences were sufficient and some other things, we could of course get development underdeveloped regions. But I fear it may be that wage differences are not sufficient to create this movement; This is a classic case and you have most likely play on the exchange rate as well.

The second point is about to be?. There I think we have less clear ideas, if you will, in that the consequences of a total economic monetary union. I think it is not very difficult, and several colleagues have done to develop the loss of autonomy of monetary policies, the need for a central system and even the small margin of autonomy of fiscal policies. It's pretty easy to develop these issues in a comprehensive and economic monetary union. We did not develop much the issue of regional transfers. It begs two problems. One: qualifying transfers in the Community, the structure will be less? that intra-national transfers in years past. For example, we will not accept? business, which was part of the policy of intra-national transfers. The transfers will perhaps not likely be made to create public enterprise, not only because it would also be questionable from the standpoint of competition and not acceptable, because fashion is not the creation of large domestic companies to state. So the transfers will be reduced in their purposes and there may be transfers to maintain a minimum income in agriculture or elsewhere, which will not create for oneself a growth? But will maintain the situation and I think it will remain as infrastructure transfers and vocational training. This will be sufficient for? growing movements in underdeveloped areas and past experience of regional policy in the Community is not an experience that is a great success. If the scope of the transfers are further reduced in places where she goes, there is concern that it is? but it is not very useful for reducing intra-national differences.

Second point which was not a very clear idea, and I think it is very difficult to have: the volume of transfers that would be required to trigger this process once we have no mechanism exchange rate. It will be a huge amount and there we had this morning raised: is this-that the rich countries citizens will accept the transfer of such a volume as they accept the less satisfied unless for transfers in their own country? Is the required volumes, we do not have an idea, will be acceptable between rich and poor regions? I think perhaps the point where we are least developed to study the consequences and necessary balances economic union and are very thorough monetary aspects of regional policy, while monetary or fiscal aspects seem simpler to me develop."

M. le Président nous avons constaté qu'un taux de change avait une valeur symbolique extrêmement élevée et que par conséquent un taux de change ? constituait une contrainte importante sur la politique et avait la fonction d'un signal avertisseur de la dégradation des situations relatives. Je voudrais dire que c'est une vue qui, par exemple dans l’histoire de mon propre  pays, n’est pas entièrement confirmée. De 1974 à 1981 nous avons pu voir se développer de très profonds déséquilibres dans notre économie et la banque centrale auprès d'une politique de taux d'intérêts qui a inversé la relation des taux d'intérêts, des taux d'intérêts à court terme plus élevés que les taux d'intérêts à long terme, a pu pendant tout un temps masquer les conséquences monétaires de cette dégradation profonde. Donc le signal avertisseur à ce moment-là n'a pas fonctionné. Il a fallu que la situation soit conduite jusqu'à une véritable catastrophe pour que, à ce moment-là, la valeur symbolique de taux de change joue et que la dévaluation soit le traumatisme nécessaire pour ? à nos syndicats la désintégration et une certaine politique d'austérité. Donc on ne peut pas être assuré que le maintien de taux de changes menacés soit suffisant pour exercer sur les hommes politiques les contraintes suffisantes. Il reste cependant que depuis 1982, en effet, la politique que nous avons suivi a consisté, comme j'ai eu l'occasion de vous expliquer quelque fois, à admettre que notre monnaie reste dans une position médiocre au sein du Système Monétaire Européen pour éviter que les hommes politiques disent: maintenant nous n'avons plus de problèmes et nous pouvons donc relâcher nos efforts, or il reste des efforts à faire sur le plan budgétaire. Ceci dit, c'était frappé par la démonstration du Professeur Thygesen, indiquant que la valeur d'instruments d‘ajustements du cours de change avait sensiblement diminué, que son efficacité comme mécanisme d'ajustement avait sensiblement diminué. Nous avons rapidement passé à un sujet qui est incontestablement lié mais qui n'est pas identique, c'est l'idée que des transferts prendraient la place de l'ajustement que le cours de change, l'évaluation du cours de change, peut permettre les ? de développement économique au sein de la Communauté et d'autres causes et d'autres remèdes que celui d'une correction qui peut être réalisée par le cours de change. Pour ma part je souhaiterai que nous puissions réfléchir un instant à un des points que la page 3 du document de nos rapporteurs en avance, en disant que ""the irrevocable locking of exchange rate parities will reduce transaction costs, remove exchange rate uncertainties and will eliminate intra-Community exchange rate movements is a source of macro-economic disturbances and competitive distortions"", parce qu'il me semble que c'est là que se trouve l'enjeu pour le reste, comme plusieurs de nos collègues l'ont indiqué, par définition des cours de changes fixés irrévocablement au fait qu'on a qu'une seule monnaie et quand on a une seule monnaie il faut une politique monétaire et cette politique monétaire doit être appuyée par des politiques économiques ? Ca c'est tout a fait rassuré, mais il me semble qu'il se justifierait que nous illustrions ces considérations concernant la réduction des cours actions, la réduction des incertitudes et donc la correction des distorsions macro-économiques et des distorsions de compétition que la certitude sur les cours de changes peuvent provoquer.","
Mr. President we found that the exchange rate had an extremely high symbolic value and therefore the exchange rate? was a major constraint on policy and had the function of a warning signal degradation related situations. I would say it is a view, for example in the history of my own country, is not fully confirmed. From 1974 to 1981 we saw develop in very serious imbalances in our economy and the central bank with an interest rate policy that reversed the relationship of interest rates, short-term interest rates higher than long-term interest rates has been for quite a while masking the monetary consequences of this profound degradation. So the warning signal at that time did not work. It took the situation is to conduct a disaster for that, at that time, the symbolic value exchange rate plays and that devaluation is necessary for trauma? our unions disintegration and a certain austerity. So we can not be assured that the risk of exchange rate maintenance is sufficient to exert sufficient constraints on the politicians. It remains that since 1982, in fact, the policy we followed consisted, as I had the opportunity to explain some time to admit that our currency remains in a poor position within the European Monetary System prevent politicians say now we have no more problems so we can relax our efforts, gold remains work to do on the fiscal front. That said, it was hit by the demonstration of Professor Thygesen, indicating that the value of instruments of exchange rate adjustments had significantly decreased its effectiveness as an adjustment mechanism had dropped significantly. We quickly moved to a subject that is undoubtedly linked but not identical, it is the idea that transfers take place of adjusting the exchange rate, the evaluation of exchange rates, may permit? economic development within the Community and other causes and remedies other than a correction that can be achieved by the exchange. For my part I wish that we could think for a moment at one of the points on page 3 of the document of the rapporteurs in advance, saying that ""the irrevocable locking of exchange rate parities will Reduce transaction costs, remove exchange rate Uncertainties and will Eliminate intra-Community exchange rate movements is a source of macro-economic disturbances and competitive distortion ""because it seems to me that this is where lies the challenge for the rest, as many of our colleagues have said, by exchange over the definition irrevocably fixed to the fact that only one currency and when you have a single currency requires a monetary policy and the monetary policy must be supported by economic policies? That's quite reassured, but I think it is justified that we Illustrious these considerations concerning the reduction of outstanding stock, reducing uncertainties and thus the correction of macroeconomic distortions and competitive distortions that certainty exchange courses can cause."

Jaans a aimablement organisé un déjeuner pour nous. Il me semble que de cette discussion, dont je continue à penser qu'elle a été utile, même si nous reviendrons à des discussions plus réalistes et plus en situation ensuite, je retiens que trois grands questions ont été soulevées.

Première question sur laquelle il n'y avait pas d'accord était la suivante: en l'absence d'ajustement par les taux de changes comment pourront se faire ressentir les déséquilibres qui interviennent entre les états, qui par définition resteront quand même souverains pour une large part? Il y eu la démonstration du Professeur Thygesen, il y a eu des controverses sur ce point. Nous devrons tirer toutes les conséquences au cours des prochains réunions.

Deuxième question qui m'a paru plus claire - vous pourrez infirmer mon propos cet après-midi, si vous le jugez bon - c'est que si on parle de la fixité des taux de changes, il doit en résulter une politique monétaire commune et forte et aussi un cadre assez strict d'encadrement des politiques budgétaires. Ce n'est pas très original ? certain, mais enfin il fallait rappeler qu'il y a une sorte de carré magique, (i) liberté de circulation des hommes, des biens et des services, (ii) liberté de circulation des mouvements de capitaux, (iii) fixité des taux de changes, (iv) politique monétaire commune. Alors on peut considérer que cela est absolument irréaliste, même dans 20 ans, mais enfin cela méritait d'être dit et surtout cela méritait - mais j'avoue que c'est plus difficile de faire dans un contexte théorique —- qu'on s'interroge sur le degré de centralisation et de la politique monétaire commune et du cadre budgétaire commun. Je crois que c'est une question qui se pose et que les chefs de gouvernements demanderont. Dans le schéma final, Messieurs, que vous tracez, d'où iront-ils, qu'est-ce qui nous reste comme marge de manoeuvre? On peut prendre cette question en partant de la situation d'aujourd'hui, si on peut apprendre, même si c'est un peu plus difficile, en fonction de l'horizon final.

Troisièmement et c'était la question que j'avais posé peut-être pas très clairement: il y a des divergences de situations dans la Communauté, entre les états et à l’intérieur des états entre les régions - ce qu'il ne faut jamais oublier. Parce que lorsqu'il y aura liberté totale de circulation des hommes, des biens, des services et des capitaux, l'économie se moquera un peu des histoires nationales; la situation dans le Piémont ne sera pas la même que dans l'Italie du sud, et à ce moment-là les ? de l‘attraction économique joueront différemment. Mais où je crois il y reste beaucoup à travailler, même si c'est très difficile, c'est de savoir quelles sont les facteurs qui peuvent permettre de rendre des déséquilibres supportables ou bien de les réduire. Enfin personne autour de cette table ne pense que même à l'intérieur de nos états nationaux il y a des situations parfaitement égales. De ce point de vue il me semble que vous ne devez pas ignorer, même si vous considérez que cela n'amènera aucun progrès, vous ne devez pas ignorer le changement qualitatif qui a été fait par le Conseil Européen entre les politiques dites structurelles qui ont été faites avant et les politiques structurelles qui vont être faites. Pas simplement dans le montant des fonds, le doublement à 50, mais également dans la nature de ces politiques qui reprennent exactement ce qu’a dit le Gouverneur Doyle. Chaque région ? son destin, évalue ses avantages et ses inconvénients et essaie de se défendre, et bien entendu même idéalement cette Europe sera tout à fait diverse. Je crois que sur ce point il faut continuer à réfléchir, parce que certains des propos entretenus ici étaient désespérants. Il n'y avait rien à faire. On ne voit même pas pourquoi certains pays sont membres de la Communauté s'il n'y a rien a faire - pour le plaisir d'en être? Non, je pense que ça doit-être plus profond que cela.

Voilà les trois points qui ont été discutés et qui mériteraient d'être repris à un moment ou à un autre, peut-être avec des papiers supplémentaires pour nourrir la discussion? Je voudrais terminer en vous disant que notre travail me semble-t-il doit être influencé par une donnée pratique. Il ne se passe rien. Au fonds de vous même, croyez-vous qu'il y aura vraiment la libéralisation totale des mouvements de capitaux pour 8 pays au 1er juillet 1990 et le grand marché intérieur pour le début 1993 le croyez-vous? Si votre réponse est oui, votre travail peut prendre 4 ou 5 ans. Si votre réponse est non, alors je crois qu'il faut y réfléchir et apporter une réponse, car l'échéance du 1er juillet 1990 est proche. Ce n'est pas innocemment que je vous avez proposé dès mars 1986 d'inscrire la libéralisation des mouvements de capitaux très vite dans le calendrier et jusqu'en 1992, c'est parce qu'à mon avis elle pose crûment les problèmes de l'intégration économique, financière et sociale de la Communauté, au moins cette avantage. Nous croyions peut-être même que l'ouverture des marchés publics ou la reconnaissance mutuelle des diplômes, car elle met en cause l'allocation des ressources financières, leur distribution, tout au long du territoire constitué par la Communauté. Je crois qu'il ne faut pas l'oublier. Si certains entre vous croient que sans aucun changement par ailleurs il y aura au 1er juillet 1990, je répète, la libéralisation totale des mouvements de capitaux et au début 1993 le grand marché sans frontières, je crois qu'ils se trompent. C'est la raison pour laquelle il faut travailler, réfléchir et trouver quelques solutions. Sur ce, en remerciant vous M. Jaans, je vous souhaite un bon appétit.","I think we have to stop here, we will resume, since Mr. JAANS graciously hosted a lunch for us. I think this discussion, which I still think it was useful, even if we will return to more realistic discussions and situation then, I note that three major issues were raised.

First question on which there was no agreement was this: in the absence of adjustment by how exchange rates will be felt imbalances that occur between states, which by definition will still sovereign to a large part? There was a demonstration of Professor Thygesen, there has been controversy on this point. We will have to draw all the consequences in the coming meetings.

Second question that seemed to me clearer - you can refute my statement this afternoon, if you see fit - is that if we speak of the fixed exchange rate, it should result in a common monetary policy and strong and as a framework strict enough framework for fiscal policies. It's not very original? sure, but finally had to remember that there is a magic square, (i) freedom of movement of people, goods and services, (ii) free movement of capital movements, (iii) fixity rates foreign exchange, (iv) monetary policy. So we can consider that it is absolutely unrealistic, even in 20 years, but finally it deserved to be told and especially deserved it - but I admit that it is more difficult to do in a theoretical context - that s 'examines the degree of centralization and the common monetary policy and common budgetary framework. I think this is an issue that arises and government leaders ask. In the final scheme, gentlemen, that you draw, where they go, what do we have left as leeway? We can take this issue on the basis of the situation today, if we can learn, even if it's a little more difficult, depending on the final horizon.

Thirdly and that was the question I posed may not be very clear: there are situations of differences in the Community, between states and within states between regions - what not Never forget. Because when there is complete freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital, the economy will laugh a little national histories; the situation in Piedmont will not be the same as in southern Italy, and then the? economic attraction will play differently. But I think there is still much to work, even if it is very difficult is to know what are the factors that can help make it bearable imbalances or reduce. Finally one around this table think even within our national states there are perfectly equal situations. From this point of view it seems to me that you should not ignore, even if you consider that it will bring no progress, you should not ignore the qualitative change that has been made by the European Council between said structural policies that have made before and structural policies will be made. Not just in the amount of funds, doubling to 50, but also in the nature of these policies which take exactly what was said Governor Doyle. Each region ? his destiny, assessing its strengths and weaknesses and try to defend themselves, and of course ideally this same Europe is quite diverse. I think on this we must continue to think, because some of the comments here were maintained heartbreaking. There was nothing to do. We do not even see why some countries are members of the Community if there is nothing to do - for the pleasure of being? No, I think it should be deeper than that.

These are the three points that were discussed and that should be taken at one time or another, perhaps with additional papers to feed the discussion? Let me conclude by telling you that our work does seem to be influenced by a particular practice. Nothing happens. To fund yourself, do you think he will really be the full liberalization of capital movements for 8 countries on 1 July 1990 and the largest domestic market in early 1993, do you? If your answer is yes, your work may take 4 or 5 years. If your answer is no, then I think we should think about it and give an answer, as the deadline of 1 July 1990 is near. It's not that I innocently you proposed in March 1986 to include the rapidly liberalizing capital flows in the calendar until 1992, it is because I believe it poses starkly the problems of economic integration, financial and social Community, at least this advantage. We thought perhaps that the opening of public procurement or mutual recognition of diplomas, because it involves the allocation of financial resources, their distribution throughout the territory constituted by the Community. I think it will not be forgotten. If some of you believe that no change otherwise there will be July 1, 1990, I repeat, the full liberalization of capital movements and early 1993, the market without frontiers, I think they are wrong. That's why you have to work, think and find some solutions. On that note, thanking you Mr. JAANS, I wish you a good appetite."
2,10/10/1988,OK,,"T, B",81,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,2nd tape side 1: 0 - 159,0,159,159,2,1,,FR,"Les 3 points qui ont été discuté ce matin. 1. Qu'arrive-t-il en l'absence d'ajustements par les taux de changes? M. Lamfalussy avait lancé la discussion sur ce point ce matin. Quelles sont les clignotants qui s'allument? S'allument ? temps utile? Mais il faut bien entendu mettre en contrepartie de cela les avantages des taux de changes fixes, avec ou sans monnaie commune, tel que 2 dans le papier des rapporteurs dans la page 3, et aussi se rappeler que s'il y avait une institution fixe chargée de ce minimum de politique économique commune, cette institution aurait en son sein des débats ? exercerait une contrainte sur les pays qui s'écarteraient par trop de la cohérence acceptée, voulu, politiquement. C'est très important, il ne faut jamais oublier cette élément. Actuellement la Communauté n'exerce une pression que sur les pays qui sont en infraction avec les règles communautaires ou bien sollicitent un prêt ou des périodes d'exonération, mais pas sur le reste. Il est évident que s'il y avait une union économique la Communauté en tant que telle représentée par une instance X a déterminer, exercerait cette contrainte. Par conséquent il faut un pays membre pour avoir autant d'inconvénients à ce que la presse et l'opinion publique sachent que ses partenaires ont fait pression sur lui pour qu'il s'ajuste, qu'il n'y en aurait avec son taux de change. C'est un élément qui n'existe pas dans le paysage actuel mais qui interviendrait. Je crois qu'il faut qu'on réfléchisse un peu sur cela avant d'avoir une opinion définitive sur cela.

2. Je crois qu'il y a un certain consensus pour admettre que la fixité des taux de changes avec ou sans monnaie commune peu importe, on dirait une politique monétaire commune et forte. Le fait qu'elle exercerait une contrainte sur les politiques nationales et qu'elle impliquerait pour le moins un cadre pour la politique budgétaire, pour les politiques budgétaires. Bien entendu il pourrait y avoir progressivité dans la contrainte. Comme le Gouverneur Duisenberg a dit ce matin, il a posé un principe qui pourrait être une étape, il pourrait y avoir équilibre du budget courant, ?? dépend en revanche pour le budget d'investissements pour y avoir un financement mixed, qui tiendrait compte d'ailleurs de la rentabilité des investissements du fait qu'ils vont profiter à plusieurs générations.

3. sur lequel il faut que nous travaillons pour soumettre des avis d'autres experts, c'est la question des déséquilibres. Je les appelle régionaux mais je devrais dire normalement des déséquilibres entre états ou des déséquilibres entre régions. Chacun a dans son ? une expérience pour les pays les plus grands graphiquement de ce que sont les déséquilibres entre régions. Mais il me semble que notre discussion a été un peu courte ce matin sur un point qui est très difficile et très contesté. Quels sont les choix de localisation des activités pour s'en rendre compte? Ces choix sont parfois surprenants, ils ne ? qu'un seul paramètre. Ce paramètre étant dans la théorie économique, la flexibilité des coûts de production, ce ? parfois à d'autres attraits ou à d'autres exigences. Je voudrais m'arrêter sur ces trois points, je savais que le Gouverneur Hoffmeyer aussi avait demandé M. Rubio, M. Lamfalussy sur ces trois points-là. Ensuite nous verrons comment: organiser la discussion, il faut garder un moment pour aussi planifier notre travail.","The 3 points that have been discussed this morning. 1. What happens there in the absence of adjustments by the exchange rate? Mr Lamfalussy launched the discussion on this point this morning. What are the indicators that light up? Light up? timely? But it is of course to return for this the advantages of fixed exchange rates, with or without a common currency, such as 2 in the paper rapporteurs on page 3, and also remember that if there was a fixed institution charged that minimum common economic policy, that institution within it debates? exert a constraint on the country which depart too the accepted consistency desired, political. This is very important, we must never forget this item. Currently the Community exerts pressure on countries which are in breach of EU rules or applying for a loan or periods of exemption, but not the rest. It is obvious that if there was an economic union Community as such represented by an instance X determine exert this constraint. Therefore there must be a member country to have as many disadvantages that the press and the public know that its partners have pressured him to fits, than there would be with her exchange rate. This is something that does not exist in the current landscape but would intervene. I think we need to reflect a little on it before a final view on this.

2. I think there is a consensus that the fixed exchange rate with or without a common currency regardless, it looks like a common and strong monetary policy. The fact that she would exert a constraint on national policies and that it would involve at least a framework for fiscal policy, for fiscal policies. Of course there may be progressive in the constraint. As Governor Duisenberg said this morning, he laid down a principle that could be a step, there could balance the current budget ?? depends on the other hand for the capital budget to be a mixed funding, which would take into account also the profitability of the investments done they will benefit several generations.

3. on which we must work to submit opinions of other experts, is the question of imbalances. I call on the regional but I would normally say imbalances between states or regional imbalances. Everyone in her? an experience for larger countries graphically what are the imbalances between regions. But it seems to me that our discussion was a little short this morning on a point that is very difficult and contested. What are the choice of location of activities to realize it? These choices are sometimes surprising, they do? only one parameter. This parameter is in economic theory, flexibility in production costs, what? sometimes other attractions or other requirements. I would like to dwell on these three points, I knew that the Governor Hoffmeyer also asked Mr. Rubio, Mr Lamfalussy on these three points there. Then we will see how to: organize the discussion, keep a moment to also plan our work."
2,10/10/1988,OK,,"T, B",82,M. A. Lamfalussy,Alexandre Lamfalussy,159 - 306,159,306,147,2,1,,EN,"I would like to say two words about the point No. 2 of your own summary. I think we all agree basically that fixity of exchange rates should impose constraints on budgetary policies. I think that is one of the very clear points on which we have an agreement. The basic reasons for that are very simple, that you cannot run an economic policy exclusively by monetary policy. We have sufficiently accused the Americans of doing that sort of thing so that we shouldn't really start doing it ourselves. The key question to my mind is how to make this constraint work and there are basically two avenues for the constraint. The one is a mutually agreed constraint by a treaty and a binding constraint, which would somehow limit the size of the budget deficit or the public sector deficit that would be acceptable for individual countries, either on the lines of those suggested by Wim Duisenberg or in a percentage of GNP, or God knows what. There are ways and means of doing that and I think by pointing out this, this doesn't mean that this is not feasible. It is perfectly feasible but of course one has to think about the techniques and the ways of making these limits clear and the ways and means of enforcing it. Now that is avenue number 1 and I think myself that this is the avenue we should follow. We may come back to the discussion on this again at a later stage. Avenue number 2 is market mechanism and here we have not really finished our discussion. A question I raise myself is to what extent can we expect that a market mechanism itself would put a constraint on budget deficits? It would normally do this by raising gradually the interest rates to a level which should discourage the high-spending government to borrow, or it may do it by stopping the lending to the government, or it may do it in both ways. I have a very simple, practical proposal to make to you and I will ask Dr. Baer - and we could perhaps do it at the BIS - to have a short factual paper on some of the historical experiences which show how this market constraint has or has not worked. I think examples should be Canada clearly, United States - we have the classical case of New York - and we may see even in some of our countries here around the table how it worked, for instance, for the indebtedness of cities or regions to which no government guarantee would apply. This is to be seen, and my simple proposition is that I will ask someone to do this because I think it is very important for us to know whether this is a dead avenue or whether it is something that makes sense. To be quite frank I have doubts about it because I think the market, if I can compare it to the international experience, may push up interest rates a little but not much, not enough and too late and then it abruptly stops lending. Latin America is a good case on a rather massive scale, but let's see it and then we can make up our minds whether we think that avenue number 1 really should be the principal avenue on which one would want to rely.","I would like to say two words about the point No. 2 of your own summary.

Robert Leigh-Pemberton,Robin Leigh-Pemberton,402 - 560,402,560,158,2,1,,EN,"Governor Hoffmeyer has exaggerated a little bit exactly what the Chancellor said in Berlin but of course it is perfectly right, the Chancellor was arguing that there was a great difference between a trade deficit which develops in a country which has a government surplus and therefore the deficit is attributable to the private sector, which is probably more rapidly adjustable either to policy responses internally or to the attitude of the market, and if there is a much more endemic problem deriving from a government deficit.

May I go onto the wide aspect of this matter of budgetary policy. Professor Lamfalussy said that he preferred the first of the two ways which he described: a binding constraint by treaty, say based on a percentage of GNP. I am not quite sure, perhaps he didn't really have the opportunity to go into too great detail, but does he envisage that this would exclude the possibility of some Community decision, say from year to year, on what is a reasonable level? No. I think that if one was bound by treaty, one might say under the terms of the treaty in any one year the overall deficit should be such and such a proportion of the Community's GNP, but what that proportion ought to be might vary from year to year and there ought to be some discretionary power to change that. I think I would be ready to accept that because I don't think it is possible to operate a budgetary policy in the circumstances in which our Chairman invites us to consider it, except in the presence of a fairly considerable central authority. If we look at some of these countries with a federal system, the United States, Canada or Switzerland, there is a degree of discretion left to the member states about their budgetary policy. I don't think it would be necessary, in the context in which we are considering, that there should be no latitude for individual countries provided that the central power which lays down the policy has the predominant ? to dispose of. What I mean by that is that in the federal systems that we see in the country at the moment, it is the central authority, the federal government or the federal central bank, that has itself considerable powers that can be used, at least partially, to offset the collective effects of the state's policies - they may even have powers to limit the state's policies. At the present moment, of course, this is not the case in the Community where the powers are extremely limited and whose budget is comparatively small in relation to the GNP of the Community as a whole or individual countries. We were talking this morning about the way individual local government authorities have behaved in France, very correctively. I have to say that in the United Kingdom we went through a period in which they behaved extremely incorrectly and succeeded in embarrassing central Government policy quite substantially, so much so that the Government put a cap on them and they succeeded in defeating that by going to the market and mortgaging their assets, their municipal housing or even the furniture and desks in their council offices. This is an illustration of how the market I think can, if the terms are right, come forward with the most unlikely and subverting reactions in terms of government policy. I would have thought within this overall idea of a central budgetary policy, it would be possible to allow some degree of latitude, and above all for the smaller countries whose debt might not be on such a-scale as to affect the overall Community position. I think we also need to be alert to the possibility of individual countries borrowing from overseas. One can always do that - and again in the United Kingdom we have had illustration of para-statal organisations who have borrowed overseas, perhaps with Government approval, and there have been embarrassing consequences occasionally by borrowing in dollars and when the moment came to repay, but that is something again where individual authorities or governments might succeed in defeating central budgetary policy and it would be necessary to guard against it. If we are going to do this we will certainly need substantially tighter co-ordination between fiscal policies than exists at the moment. I think I agree with Professor Lamfalussy that this would involve an element of obligation on member states rather than the present acceptance or voluntary arrangements that we have now.","Governor Hoffmeyer has exaggerated a little bit exactly what the Chancellor said in Berlin but of course it is perfectly right, the Chancellor was arguing that there was a great difference between a trade deficit which develops in a country which has a government surplus and therefore the deficit is attributable to the private sector, which is probably more rapidly adjustable either to policy responses internally or to the attitude of the market, and if there is a much more endemic problem deriving from a government deficit.

Sans vouloir prendre partie, je donne la parole à Frans Andriessen sur le rapport, il faut quand même me semble-t-il que ce rapport ait trois grandes parties. Une qui explique dans quelle contexte la construction de l'Europe se situe notre réflexion, il faut tenir d'où nous en sommes, des décisions prises, des décisions qui vont être prises, et à l'intérieur de cette réflexion dans l'ensemble il faut apprécier le rôle qu'a joué le Système Monétaire Européen, c'est indispensable. Une deuxième partie dans laquelle on doit dire avec sans doute de la prudence jusqu'où ? union économique, bien sûr il ne faut pas non plus effrayer les gouvernements, mais il ne faut pas non plus leur mentir, c'est le sens de la discussion de ce matin. J'y reviendrai après l'intervention de Frans Andriessen, puisque M. Lamfalussy a posé clairement une question, puis il y aura une troisième partie qui dira: voilà le premier pas il ? pourrons faire et vous aurez à discuter pour savoir si ce premier pas est le premier pas d'un engrenage comme dans le traité du Système Monétaire Européen, ou un premier pas sans qu'il y ait engrenage ou une certaine progressivité, mais sans qu'il y ait des étapes fermes, parce que la Communauté a 2 ? en souvenir de chaque fois qu'ils ont à décider que ? choses deux ans après, elle n’a généralement pas pu le faire. Il y a ces trois éléments, ce n'est pas le plan du rapport.

Donc aujourd'hui nous sommes sur le 2, mais il faut être prudent, il ne faut pas décrire un mécanisme pur qui ferait abstraction de l'histoire économique, des traditions de nos pays, des réticences à concéder des transferts de souveraineté. Il faudra être prudent dans tout cela mais quand même il faut bien indiquer aux gouvernements jusqu'où peut-être ils iront. Je crois que c'est important pour eux de savoir et pour nous pour la discussion aussi, puisque la preuve en ? c'est que ce matin il y a eu des opinions divergentes qui ont été avancées sur la manière de limiter ou de voir réduire les déséquilibres à l'intérieur de la zone Europe - chacun en fonction de son expérience et autres. Sur ça, si vous le permettez, j'y reviendrai tout à l'heure, parce qu'il faut également tenir compte de ce qui a été décidé dans la Communauté de ce point de vue.","We will be cautious but when the European Council accepted the White Paper with the 1992 target was somehow a bit reckless, daring say. Without taking sides, I give the floor to Frans Andriessen on the report, you still have to me it seems that this report has three main parts. A explains what context the construction of Europe is our thinking must be where we are, the decisions made, decisions that will be taken, within this overall reflection we must appreciate the role played by the European Monetary System is needed. A second part in which it must be said with no doubt the prudence far? economic union, of course we must not frighten governments, but do not lie to them, it is the sense of the discussion this morning. I will come back after the intervention of Frans Andriessen, as Mr Lamfalussy has clearly asked a question and then there will be a third party that will say it's the first step? can do and you will have to discuss whether this first step is the first step of a gear as in the European Monetary System Treaty, or a first step without gear or a certain progress, but that there is firm steps because the Community 2? remember each time they have to decide that? things two years later, it has generally not been able to. There are these three elements, it is not the plan of the report.

So today we are about 2, but be careful, do not describe a pure mechanism that would ignore the economic history and traditions of our countries, reluctant to concede sovereignty transfer. Caution should be used in all of this but still we have to tell the government how far may they go. I think it is important for them to know and for us for discussion too, since the proof? is that this morning there were differing opinions that have been advanced on how to limit or seeing reduce imbalances within the European area - each according to his experience and others. On this, if I may, I will come back on time, because you have to also take into account what has been decided in the Community from that point of view."

Je voudrais vous poser une question sur le cadre dans lequel cette union économique et monétaire fonctionnerait. Il y a une majorité d'entre vous qui s'est exprimée en disant: on ne peut pas compter uniquement sur les forces du marché pour fournir en temps utile le clignotant nécessaire ou avoir les effets qui permettraient un pays de corriger une politique aux effets négatifs. Le marché ne suffit pas et entre-temps il peut y avoir des effets ? sur l'ensemble de la zone. S'il en est ainsi en plus des effets du marché et en ne tenant pas compte pour l'instant des chocs extérieurs, car cela complique la situation, il y a deux manières d'aller plus loin. 1, c'est par un traité - il y a par exemple en Allemagne une loi sur la croissance dans la stabilité qui a servi de cadre, si je suis bien informé, à la politique allemande et puis il y a les décisions ex ante de ce que j'ai appelé pour la commodité une institution X. Je n'ai pas voulu qualifier cette institution pour l'instant, car je vous le répète il y a deux manières a priori de l'envisager, ou bien dans un stade ultérieur il y aura dans chaque gouvernement un vice-président du Conseil, ou un vice-premier ministre, qui viendra à Bruxelles tous les 15 jours arbitrer les problèmes, ou bien on aura renforcé subséquemment les pouvoirs de la Commission. C'est un ou l'autre. Mais à savoir si à votre avis vous mettriez beaucoup d'éléments dans un traité, bien si au contraire vous partageriez dans le fonds le cadre entre un traité et les responsabilités de cette institution. L'avantage d'un traité c'est qu'il fixe des étapes et, qu'il ? clairement le choix, c'est un engagement. Son inconvénient c'est qu'il risque d'être trop rigide par rapport aux évolutions des économies due à la fois à des contraintes extérieures ou intérieures. De ce point de vue des expériences historiques montrent que si on fige trop la situation dans un traité, on risque un jour d'avoir un éclatement ou bien d'oublier le traité, ce qui est arrivé aussi. Puis l'avantage d'une institution X c'est qu'elle peut s'adapter davantage, son inconvénient c'est qu'elle peut un jour sombrer dans l’impuissance. C'est à dire qu'il n'y a pas d'accord, si c'est la Commission qui a le pouvoir, elle est désavouée par le Conseil Européen ou le Conseil des Ministres, si c'est le Conseil des Ministres il y a une crise et ils ne se mettent pas d'accord. Si déjà aujourd'hui vous aviez des avis, des indications à donner sur ce point, ensuite nous passerons, si vous le voulez bien, la parole au Président Pöhl qui a récapitulé dans son papier l'ensemble des éléments et je crois qu'on pourrait fonctionner, on pourrait ensuite à ce propos soulever la question des indicateurs, c'est à dire d'avoir une batterie d'indicateurs qui rendrait plus transparente et plus claire les politiques qui seraient menées. D'abord sur cette question traité ou institution, est-ce-que ça inspire certains d'entre vous, est-ce-qu'ils estiment que c'est trop loin ? pour que ça mérite la peine d'être discuté 5 minutes?","Before continuing I take another chapter because I would return to the paper of President Pöhl which indicated the different macro-economic policies, micro-economic, external policies, for us to think a little about it whatever the case, a strong union or a sweet union, whatever. Let me ask you a question about the context in which this economic and monetary union work. There is a majority of you who spoke saying, we can not rely solely on market forces to provide timely necessary flashing or having effects that would permit countries to correct political effects negative. The market is not enough and in the meantime there may be effects? on the whole area. If this is so in addition to the effects of the market and ignoring for the moment external shocks because it complicates the situation, there are two ways to go further. 1 is a treaty - there is for example in Germany a law on growth in the stability that provided the framework, if I am correctly informed, in German politics and then there are the ex ante decisions I have called for the convenience institution X. I did not want to call this institution at the moment, because I repeat you priori there are two ways has to consider, or at a later stage there will be in every government vice-chairman, or deputy prime minister, who will come to Brussels every 15 days arbitrate problems, or we will subsequently strengthened the powers of the Commission. It's one or the other. But whether you think you would put a lot of elements in a treaty, if on the contrary you share in the fund part between a treaty and responsibilities of this institution. The advantage of a treaty is that it sets and stages, it? clear choice, it is a commitment. Its disadvantage is that it may be too rigid with respect to changes in savings due to both external and internal constraints. From this point of view of historical experiences show that if one freezes too the situation in a treaty, it may one day to have a break or forget the treaty, which also happened. Then the advantage of X institution is that it can accommodate more, its drawback is that it may one day sink into impotence. This means that there is no agreement, if the Commission has the power, she is disowned by the European Council or the Council of Ministers, if the Council of Ministers it there is a crisis and they do not agree. If you already today reviews, directions to this point, then we will, if you please, the floor to President Pöhl who summarized in his paper all the elements and I think we might work, then we could about that raise the question of indicators, ie to have a set of indicators that would make it more transparent and clear policies that would be conducted. First on the issue treaty or institution, do-it inspires some of you, is this-they feel that it is too far? for it to merit worth discussing 5 minutes?"

Je crois que c'est une très utile question. Je vais y répondre le plus rapidement possible. Je voudrais avant ça dire quelques mots de la discussion que nous avons eu tout à l'heure. Il me semble que notre mandat nous oblige de répondre aux chefs d'états à la question: comment instituer une union économique et monétaire. Il me semble que nous ne pouvons pas éluder la question de ce qui se passerait, quelles seraient les implications d'un système où les parités seraient irrévocablement fixées, car ça fait partie de notre mandat. Nous ne sommes pas obligés d'être d'accord sur le caractère souhaitable d'un tel état de choses et je crois que nous ne pouvons pas éluder la question. Il me semble, comme on l'a dit ce matin, qu'une telle situation implique l’unité des politiques monétaires, des participants à un tel système ou en tout cas une coordination extrêmement étroite de ces politiques monétaires. Ca n'est pas très intéressant parce que tout le monde le sait. Ce qui est plus intéressant c’est deux choses. 1, de montrer comment on peut réaliser cette unification ou cette très étroite intégration des politiques monétaires. On ne peut pas le faire par miracle, par une baguette magique, on peut le faire si on s'organise pour le faire. Je pense, pour répondre à votre question sur le traité, qu'il y a de tels abandons de souveraineté dans l'intégration des politiques monétaires internes qu'il faut un traité pour prévoir comment on aboutira un tel objectif. Je pense aussi que ce traité ne doit pas, pour répondre à une de vos questions, fixer dans le détail les modalités de passage d'une phase à l'autre qui permettront d'arriver à l'intégration totale, parce que ces modalités dépendront de trop de variables. Ce qu'on peut prévoir c'est la description des phases. On peut commencer par une phase modeste, peut-être la mise en commun d'une partie de nos réserves avec les fonctions d'intervention commune sur cette mise en commun, avec des éléments décisionnels qui permettent de faire fonctionner cette fonction commune. Puis on peut imaginer une phase 2 où il y ait une coordination des politiques en matière d'agrégats monétaires. Puis on peut imaginer une phase 3 où on irait un peu plus loin, où il y aurait des interventions communes d'organes très rapprochés sur les marchés monétaires internes et puis etc. jusqu'à L'intégration totale. Ces différentes phases doivent être décrites et à mon avis elles doivent être intégrées dans une description de traité - je ne dis pas projet de traité, je ne dis pas que nous devions tous soumettre aux chefs d'états pour le mois de juin un projet de traité. Mais comme on nous a posé la question à quoi ressemblerait une union monétaire, il faut être capable de la décrire et de la décrire en phases, en stades successifs. On peut très bien imaginer d'ailleurs que ce traité comporte la nécessité de l'unanimité pour le passage d'une phase à l'autre, ce qui garantirait les souverainetés nationales. Je crois qu'il serait difficile de ne pas répondre à la question qui nous est posée par les ? d'un traité. Mais ce traité à mon avis ne doit pas être trop précis, surtout dans les phases je dirais les plus lointaines et les plus ambitieuses, il doit poser des principes et en même temps fixer la règle de l'unanimité pour le passage des différentes phases. Il doit aussi comporter, comme on l'a dit longuement ce matin, des éléments de parallélisme ou des éléments adjugeant qui concernent notamment le domaine de la politique budgétaire. Il va sans dire qu'une politique monétaire commune, qui est celle qu'implique un pareil traité n'a pas de sens si les politiques budgétaires restent divergentes, ça a été fortement dit ce matin et je crois que tout le monde est d'accord là-dessus. On a aussi dit que les clignotants du marché mettraient beaucoup de temps à agir et donc qu'il faudra des contraintes et des contraintes d'autant plus fortes qu'on ira vers les phases ultimes de la construction monétaire. Ces contraintes doivent être dessinées, et moi je demande aux rapporteurs de nous décrire des modalités possibles d'une contrainte croissante dans le domaine budgétaire. M. Duisenberg a donné une idée intéressante: celle de l'équilibre des budgets de fonctionnement face à des budgets d'investissements qui pourraient être différentes de pays à pays; M. Lamfalussy a évoqué des questions de maximum en terme de pourcentage de produit intérieur brut, je crois qu'il faut éviter d'être trop rigide, parce que comme M. Hoffmeyer l'a dit il peut y avoir des raisons macro-économiques pour un pays qui a une forte épargne de se permettre un déficit budgétaire un peu plus large qu'un autre, et donc il faut prévoir une certaine flexibilité à l'intérieur du cadre commun, mail le cadre commun doit exister. Moi j'ai vu fonctionner une union monétaire très différente: c'est la zone franc en Afrique, ça ne marche que lorsqu'il y a un cadre budgétaire, sans quoi chacun veut mettre la main sur les ressources du pool et donc il faut savoir qu'on aura une autre donne, une autre politique budgétaire commune que celle qui existe aujourd'hui. Il faut un organe central pour la gérer. C'est absolument clair, et il faudra donc créer au niveau communautaire une source de pouvoir disciplinaire qui à mon avis ne devrait pas être laissé complètement dans les mains d'un organe, dites commission, parce que c'est un peu excessif et vous avez vous-mêmes dit que ça avait ces limites. Il ne faut pas non plus nous laisser dans les mains d'un conseil des ministres qui ne serait pas dans une certaine mesure cadré et donc il faut que le traité prévoit lui-même, sinon dans le détail du moins la logique de cette contrainte accrue. C'est là où l'imagination et le savoir de vos rédacteurs et les institutionnalistes qui sont à leur disposition sont très importants si nous voulons faire un travail utile. Je ne dis pas que c'est nos propositions mais si nous voulons faire un travail utile il faut pouvoir donner aux chefs d'états une ébauche de ce que vous voudrez dire si on y croyait sérieusement ce concept union économique et monétaire. Je crois que c'est faisable, je crois que c'est extrêmement difficile sur le plan politique, et je crois que c'est faisable intellectuellement et c'est notre rôle de le faire. Si nous disons voilà l'objectif lointain: union monétaire, mais il y a une montagne de ""prerequisites"", nous n'aurons pas fait notre travail et on dira une fois de plus, les gouverneurs de banques

centrales sont des gens ultra-conservateurs, sans imagination et qui montrent la difficulté des entreprises. Si en revanche nous disons, vous voulez une union économique et monétaire, voila à quoi ça ressemble, c'est très compliqué, il y a énormément de contraintes, il faut des banques centrales autonomes - autonomes parce que pour les confédérés il faut qu'elles soient autonomes et qu'elles aient un degré homogène d'autonomie et d'indépendance - il faut une politique monétaire commune mais ça n'a de sens que si vous avez une politique budgétaire contraignante et coordonnée, alors à ce moment-là il faut pas dire les gouverneurs non pas fait leur travail mais eux-mêmes verront la complexité du processus politique qu'ils ont voulu déclencher. Je crois que c'est des choses qu'on peut décrire et moi j'aimerais  beaucoup que le rapport que nous ferons comporte ces descriptions.","
I think it is a very useful question. I will answer as soon as possible. I would say a few words before that the discussion we had earlier. It seems to me that our mandate requires us to meet the heads of state to the question: how to establish an economic and monetary union. It seems to me that we can not avoid the question of what would happen, what would be the implications of a system in which exchange rates would be irrevocably fixed, because it's part of our mandate. We are not obliged to agree on the desirability of such a state of things and I think we can not avoid the question. It seems to me, as we said this morning, that this situation implies unity of monetary policies, the participants in such a system or at least a very close coordination of monetary policies. It's not very interesting because everybody knows. What is more interesting is two things. 1, to show how we can achieve this unification or integration of this very narrow monetary policies. We can not do a miracle, a magic wand, you can do it if we organize to do it. I think, to answer your question about the treaty, there is such surrender of sovereignty in the integration of internal monetary policies need a treaty to predict how we lead such an objective. I also think that this treaty should not, to answer one of your questions, fix in detail the modalities of passage from one phase to another that will achieve full integration, because these arrangements will depend too many variables. What we can predict is the description of the phases. We can start with a small stage, maybe the sharing of a portion of our reserves with the common response functions on this pool, with decision points that can make this common function. Then a phase 2 we can imagine that there is a policy coordination in monetary aggregates. Then we can imagine a phase 3 where it would go a step further, where there would be joint interventions with very close internal organs on money markets and then etc. up Full integration. These phases should be described and in my opinion should be incorporated in a treaty description - I do not say draft treaty, I do not say that we all submit to the heads of states for the June draft treaty. But as we posed the question what would a monetary union must be able to describe and describe phases in successive stages. this treaty can well imagine that also includes the need for unanimity for passage from one phase to the other, which would guarantee national sovereignty. I think it would be hard not to answer the question posed to us by? a treaty. But this treaty in my opinion should not be too accurate, especially in phases I would say the most distant and most ambitious, it must lay down principles and at the same time secure the unanimity rule for the passage of the different phases. It should also include, as mentioned at length this morning parallelism clinching elements or elements which concern in particular the area of ​​fiscal policy. It goes without saying that a common monetary policy, which implies that such a treaty is meaningless if fiscal policies are different, it was strongly indicated this morning and I think everyone is of agree on that. Market flashing It was also said that would take a long time to act and therefore it will take the stresses and constraints all the stronger we will go to the final stages of monetary construction. These constraints must be drawn, and I asked the rapporteurs to describe possible ways of increasing stress in the budgetary field. Mr Duisenberg gave an interesting idea: to balance operating budgets face capital budgets that might be different from country to country; Lamfalussy evoked many questions in terms of percentage of GDP, I think we should avoid being too rigid, because as Mr. Hoffmeyer said there may be macroeconomic reasons for a country that has a high savings to afford a budget deficit slightly larger than the other, and therefore there must be some flexibility within the common framework, email the common framework must exist. I saw him run a very different monetary union: the franc zone in Africa, it only works when there is a budget framework, otherwise everyone wants to get in on the pool of resources and therefore must know that we will have another gives, another common fiscal policy than exists today. We need a central body to manage it. It is absolutely clear, and it will therefore create at Community level a source of disciplinary power which in my opinion should not be left entirely in the hands of an organ, say committee, because it's a bit excessive and you yourselves have said it was those limits. Do not leave us in the hands of a council of ministers that would not be to some extent framed and therefore we need the Treaty provides for himself, if not in detail at least the logic of this increased stress . This is where the imagination and knowledge of your editors, and institutionalists that are available to them are very important if we want to do useful work. I'm not saying this is our proposal, but if we do useful work there must be give to heads of states a draft of what you will say if it seriously believed this concept economic and monetary union. I think it's doable, I believe it is extremely difficult politically, and I think it is intellectually feasible and what is our role to do. If we say this is the distant goal: monetary union, but there is a mountain of ""prerequisites"", we have not done our job and we say again, bank governors

plants are people ultra-conservative, unimaginative and show the troubled companies. However, if we say, you want an economic and monetary union, here is what it looks like, it's very complicated, there are a lot of constraints, there must be autonomous central banks - independent because for the Confederate requires that they are autonomous and that they have a uniform degree of autonomy and independence - you have a common monetary policy but it makes sense only if you have a restrictive budget policy and coordinated, while at that time it must not mean the governors not doing their job but they themselves will see the complexity of the policy they wanted to trigger the process. I think it's things we can describe and I'd love to report that we will include these descriptions."

If there is to be a common monetary policy as one aspect of the whole exercise - we now have national monetary policies governed by national law where in the law it is described what it does and what the objectives of the monetary authority are and also its limitations - if there is to be a common monetary policy, it is I think indispensable to set out the tasks and objectives and implementations of that policy or that institution by law, i.e. in a treaty which then supersedes national law.

2,10/10/1988,OK,,"T, B",91,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,1235 - 1380,1235,1380,145,2,1,,FR,"En ce qui concerne cette conception d'Europe à deux vitesses, il faut absolument l'étudier ici, tout en sachant qu'elle a une connotation péjorative à l'extérieur. Lorsque les Chefs d'états et de gouvernements se réunissent et participaient à de nombreux Conseils européens dès qu'on parle de l'Europe à deux vitesses il y a beaucoup de susceptibilité autour de la table puisque être dans le second peloton ce n'est pas bien. Il faut dépassionner cette question qui est réelle. Jusqu'à présent il existe des mécanismes à deux vitesses dans la Communauté, mais ceux qui sont dans le second peloton ont toujours affirmé leur volonté politique de participer pleinement à toute la vie communautaire. Donc ils ont eu des périodes de transition. Ca n'est pas la même chose, par exemple pour la libéralisation des mouvements de capitaux, quatre pays ont demandé une période de transition mais ils ont affirmé leur volonté d'être un jour dans la libéralisation totale des mouvements de capitaux. Tout le monde a compris qu'il fallait du temps et d'ailleurs les gouvernements de ces pays prennent des mesures qui vont dans le sens de raccourcir même cette période de transition. A propos de l'union économique et monétaire nous aurons deux cas de figures pour être tout à fait franc. Nous aurons ceux qui diront: nous voulons un délai, nous sommes d'accord sur l'objectif politique mais nous demandons un délai, et il y a ceux qui diront: nous n'acceptons pas les fondements mêmes de l'union économique et monétaire. Ce sont deux cas différents. Le premier cas nous savons en gérer au niveau de notre groupe, le deuxième nous dépasse. Oui, il faut bien se rendre compte que si deux ou trois gouvernements disent: pour nous la construction européenne n'a pas comme perspective cette union économique et monétaire, pour telle ou telle raison, alors là nous sommes devant un cas de figures tout à fait nouveau et moi je conseillerais qu'on étudie dans ce rapport ce cas de figures-là, parce qu'il y a des conséquences très graves. En revanche on peut étudier le premier, et il me semble que l‘union économique et monétaire se greffe assez bien sur la décision fondamentale prise pour la libération des mouvements de capitaux. Il y a des périodes de transition. Mais si des pays disaient je refuse, un pays ou deux pays disaient nous refusons, la perspective union économique et monétaire alors là, comme le disait le Gouverneur Duisenberg, il faudrait deux contrats de mariage en quelque sorte. L'un pour ceux qui veulent aller jusqu'au bout et un autre, plus limité, pour ceux qui disent nous voulons bien faire un chemin avec vous mais pas tout le chemin, et ceci nous renvoit à un problème extrêmement complexe, difficile, qui d'ailleurs se posera même si les douze veulent aller ensemble jusqu'au bout du chemin, puisque la Suède, la Norvège, l'Autriche vont nous poser cette question dans les 5 à 10 ans qui viennent. Je n'oublie ni la Turquie, ni Chypre, ni Malte. Je crois qu'il faut bien distinguer les deux et pour le faire d'une manière paisible qui ne préjuge en rien des décisions politiques qui seront prises, il faut être dans l’esprit de la décision sur la libération du mouvement des capitaux. Si par exemple nous décrivons, comme le suggère le Gouverneur de Larosière, une première étape, il est possible que l'on dise que cette première étape, tous les pays ne peuvent pas la franchir par exemple lors de la libération totale des mouvements des capitaux. Nous prévoyons des périodes de transition, mais les mécanismes globaux restent les mêmes. C'est donc une situation différente de la seconde, que pour ma part je ne conseille pas d'évoquer dans le rapport, parce que c'est un autre rapport, c'est une crise de la Communauté, une crise sur le consensus, sur ??. La première bien entendu il faut la décrire. Cette conversation s'est changée très utile pour les rapporteurs et pour moi de savoir traité, institution, comme M. de Larosière a bien voulu reprendre cette distinction qui est à mon avis importante, moi je vous ai parlé franchement, je ne plaide pas pour un renforcement des pouvoirs de la Commission, j'en vois les limites, mais je pense que si nous allons trop loin dans la spécification des contraintes dans le traité ce sera considéré comme irréaliste, inacceptable et de toute manière il faut une institution qui exerce une coordination ex ante, ou si vous voulez on peut dire ça d'une autre manière: il faut revoir la directive de 1974 sur la convergence des économies qui a montré ses limites et a montré franchement ses limites, puisque cette exercice auquel nous nous livrons ressemblerait - je profite que le Pape Jean-Paul II est en France pour dire - à une messe sans la ?. C’est ça la directive 1974 sur la convergence des économies. On ne se dit rien, ils ont dit plus au sein du Comité des Gouverneurs et sein du Comité Monétaire qu'au niveau des Ministres. Les Ministres passent un quart d'heure ou une demi heure à la rigueur sur chaque exercice de la convergence. En revanche quand j'assiste au Comité des Gouverneurs vous vous parlez franchement, l'échange est utile. Au Comité Monétaire aussi sur la base maintenant de ces indicateurs qui commencent, mais pas au seins du ... Donc si on gardait la directive de 1974, tout notre exercice tombe, donc c'est pour ça que si certains d’entre vous veulent préciser leurs pensées aujourd'hui ou la prochaine fois ou par écrit sur cette répartition entre traité, centre de décision économique, j'ai appelé institution X, et effets du marché je crois que ce serait intéressant pour tout le monde. Bien sûr les hommes politiques ensuite ? tous cela autrement mais nous, comme l'a dit le Gouverneur on attend de nous qu'on précise en termes économiques ce que cela veut dire, les différentes étapes possibles et les différents scénarios possibles pour qu'on ? tel ou tel tâche au marché, au centre de décision économique ou au traité.","Regarding this two-speed Europe of design, it is essential to study here, knowing that it has a pejorative connotation outside. When the Heads of State and Government meet and participated in many European Councils when we talk about the two-speed Europe there is much susceptibility to the table as being in the second pack is not not good. We must defuse this issue is real. So far there are two speed mechanisms in the Community, but those in the second pack have always stated their political will to participate fully in community life. So they got transition periods. It's not the same, for example for the liberalization of capital movements, four countries have requested a transitional period but they affirmed their desire to be a day in the full liberalization of capital movements. Everyone understands that it takes time and also the governments of these countries are taking steps in the direction of even shorten this period of transition. About the economic and monetary union we have two cases to be quite frank. We will have those who will say, we want a delay, we agree on the policy objective but we require a delay, and there are those who will say we do not accept the very foundations of economic and monetary union . These are two different cases. The first case we know manage at our group, the second beyond us. Yes, we must realize that if two or three governments say for us European integration is not as perspective economic and monetary union, for whatever reason, then here we are facing a very scenarios new facts and I suggest we study in this report what scenarios there, because there are very serious consequences. However we can study the first, and it seems that economic and monetary union transplant well enough on the fundamental decision for the liberalization of capital movements. There are transition periods. But if countries were saying I refuse, country or two countries saying we reject the prospect economic and monetary union while there, in the words of Governor Duisenberg, it would take two marriage contracts in some way. One for those who want to go all the way and another, more limited for those who say we want to get a way with you, but not all the way, and this returns us to an extremely complex problem, difficult, which also will arise even if the twelve want to go together until the end of the road, since Sweden, Norway, Austria will ask this question in the 5 to 10 years ahead. I forget neither Turkey nor Cyprus or Malta. I believe we must distinguish between the two and to do it in a peaceful way that prejudges political decisions to be taken, it must be in the spirit of the decision on the release of the movement of capital. If for example we describe, as suggested by the Governor de Larosière, a first step, it is possible to be told that this first step, all countries can not cross it for example when the total liberalization of capital movements . We foresee transition periods, but overall mechanisms remain the same. This is a different situation from the second, that for my part I do not advise to mention in the report, because it's another report, this is a Community crisis, a crisis of consensus sure ??. The first course must describe. This conversation has changed very useful for rapporteurs and for me to know Treaty institution, as Mr. de Larosière kindly take this distinction is important in my opinion, I told you frankly, I do not advocate strengthening the powers of the Commission, I see the limits, but I think if we go too far in the specification of constraints in the treaty that will be considered unrealistic, unacceptable and in any case must be an institution that exerts ex ante coordination, or you can say that we want a different way: we must review the directive of 1974 economic convergence that has shown its limitations and has openly shown its limits, since this exercise we look like we deliver - I take that Pope John Paul II is in France to say - a Mass without the?. That's Directive 1974 economic convergence. We did not say anything, they said within the Committee of Governors and within the Monetary Committee at the level of Ministers. Ministers spend fifteen minutes or half an hour to the rigor of each year of convergence. However when I attended the Committee of Governors you talk frankly exchange is useful. At the Monetary Committee also now on the basis of these indicators beginning, but not the breasts ... So if we kept the directive of 1974, our entire exercise falls, so this is why if some of you want clarify their thoughts today or the next time or in writing in this distribution between treaty central economic decision, I called X institution, and effects of the market I think it would be interesting for everyone. Of course politicians then? otherwise all this but we, as said the Governor is expected of us says that in economic terms what this means, the different possible steps and the possible scenarios for you? a particular job market, the center of economic decision or treaty."

First, the Committee in Basel - and you will remember that I have very often explained what the environment for monetary policy in Germany is and I have gone as far as I could. Another institution is for instance the G7 where we also have the same problem, where we discuss the matters but I am not in a position and neither is the Finance Minister - he is even less in a position - to make any ex ante commitment on monetary policy, legally. This was one of the reasons for the troubles we had and for the misunderstandings. Another institution, a very recent one, is the German-French Council on economic and fiscal policy where we have the same problem. All that I am going to say is only that we have to tell the Council that if they want a closer ex ante co-operation, consultation - which I think is absolutely necessary, I am in favour of that, I am not against it - then it needs a change in national legislation. That is, in the case of Germany but maybe in other countries as well, maybe you have similar problems or different problems.

Since I have the floor, Mr. Chairman, with your permission maybe I could say a few more words on the procedure of our work because I think we have had now 6 or 8 hours of discussion in our group and we are expected to make some concrete proposals, or proposals for concrete steps, in the direction of economic and monetary union. The time I think is beginning to run. I ask myself how can we proceed, how can we go ahead? I have sent you these papers just as a kind of material, as an analytical paper not as proposals - there are practically no proposals in those papers. Maybe it is useful for the rapporteurs and for you as well just to clarify the problems and to analyse the very complicated issue. I do not expect that these papers would become the raw material for the final report. What I would suggest is that we ask our rapporteurs to prepare a first draft for report as soon as possible. It should in my view contain maybe three parts.

1. A description, so to say, of the final stage, because I think it is good after so many partly confusing discussions to have a clear picture of what we are aiming for. What is the final objective? My feeling is that it wouldn't be so difficult to make a draft of that kind because at least amongst ourselves there is - that is my impression at least - some agreement on how economic and monetary union should look finally. I don't want to go into too much detail but I think we all agree that it should be a system with free capital movements, with free movement for goods and services and people and capital as well, it should be a system with stable prices and sufficient growth, etc. We have to say a word about the relations of this system with the outside world, in other words, what kind of exchange rate policy can we envisage in the final system? My answer would be domestic price stability, we should have the first priority versus exchange rate stability. In other words we should not put all the emphasis on exchange rate stability, we should stress more the necessity of price stability, etc. In this context the final stage in the first chapter: I think we also agree that a certain degree of fiscal harmonisation is necessary, as much as necessary but not more than necessary. It should be a federalistic, decentralised system. We also certainly agree that some kind of common monetary policy is necessary in an economic and monetary union with fixed exchange rates and free capital movements. I would even go one step forward and say if we have a common monetary policy it would be desirable, in the final stage at least, to have a kind of a European central bank system - I would not say a central bank I would rather prefer the word central bank system - more associated with the Federal Reserve System, for instance, rather decentralised. Of course if you have irrevocably fixed exchange rates, Erik, you can even have a common currency as well. In the final stage that could be envisaged and it should be described, the consequences for regional developments, etc., on the lines we have described this morning. That would be the first chapter.

2. The second chapter could be how far have we developed in that direction? I think we should not give the impression that we are starting from scratch, we have made enormous progress in the direction of both economic and monetary union, we already have a high degree of integration in the markets for goods and services and that should be completed by 1992 - that is the clear decision of the participating governments, no doubt about that. So we are not starting at zero, we have made enormous progress. We have also made progress in the monetary field, we have the European Monetary System which is a system of fixed exchange rates if not irrevocably fixed exchange rates, but rather stable, and we have reached enormous progress in convergence of economic and fiscal policies, economic policies in particular, and economic results - inflation rates, etc. That I think we should also describe in order to make the whole thing a little more balanced. On the one hand you have the utopia, so to say, and on the other hand you have the reality.

3. The third chapter should be concrete steps to the final stage. What can be envisaged? What is possible? What is realistic?

4. The fourth thing I think we should say is what are the objectives, what are we aiming for? There we come back to this question of inflation or non-inflation growth and exchange rates, which is a very concrete problem. We should say something about convergence as well, convergence of macro-economic policies. I think we can reach agreement and the governments also - that is also one of the progresses we have made in the last 15 years that there is not much disagreement of what the macro-economic, targets are. Nobody is really of the opinion that there is a trade-off between inflation and full employment, in other words that you get a little more employment by allowing a little more inflation, this is an old-fashioned theory and I think it was already buried, so to say, in the 1970s. The next paragraph should be on structural policies, including regional policies. Personally, I am very much of the opinion that we as central bank governors could also say that if we want steps towards economic and monetary union the mechanisms of transfer of resources have to be improved. We have done a lot in that direction but we cannot put all the burden, so to say, of adjustment neither on the exchange rate nor on monetary policy. So there have to be additional mechanisms and transfer of resources. Some people wouldn't like to hear that, I know, but I would be prepared to subscribe to that and that is from an objective point of view I think it is necessary to say to make the whole report also balanced. There should be a paragraph, of course, on budgetary policies. I ask myself in the light of the discussions we have had here this afternoon and this morning whether we are not able to make a suggestion and say: this and this criteria should be applied to fiscal policy. For instance, there should be limits for budget deficits in terms of GDP, national savings, whether we could find some criteria that we could tell the Heads of State and governments, we, as central bank governors or this group think that in making progress in the direction of economic and monetary union it would be very helpful, if not necessary, to have some understanding of what degree of budget deficits are tolerable under normal circumstances. I think one could say something in that direction as it was indicated here this morning.

Then one comes to the exchange rate mechanism. I am sorry that we have to repeat what some of us at least have said again and again that the EMS, which is the nucleus of a monetary union, is still incomplete. That is as a matter of fact, I think one cannot ignore that, and if we have to make suggestions to the heads of state and governments we have to tell them, please before we talk about monetary union we have to either complete the EMS or decide whether we want to have two systems. That is a decision which we cannot take but which you have to take.

The next point would be on liberalisation. This is a very important if not historical decision which the Council took in June on the liberalisation of capital movements, but I think it would be reasonable if this group would emphasise again in its report that that should be implemented as soon as possible. Of course, we can also say how much we appreciate that some countries have done something in that direction recently - Denmark, Italy, France, etc.

The next paragraph would be on monetary policy. Personally, I am of the opinion that we could propose to the Council the strengthening of the Committee of Governors, the powers of the Committee of Governors, but that is of course a little delicate for us to say we want to have more power, please help us or create the preconditions for that. On the other hand, what are the alternatives? If we say we want closer co-operation in the field of monetary policy, which is already at this stage I think very necessary, one has to ask oneself where should it be done and who should do it? I am very much against that this should be done in the Monetary Committee because the Monetary Committee is not at the same level so to say, and from my point of view it is also not acceptable that the governments would be included in the process of decision-making. So the Monetary Committee is very useful but it is not on the same level so to say. FECOM, as it is constructed, I think is not the right body, that was at a time at the end of 1970s when one thought one could develop FECOM into a kind of European IMF, but this has been demonstrated and shown that that is not necessary. I think the Committee of Central Bank Governors would be the right institution for a closer co-operation of monetary policy, maybe someone can find the right words for that and maybe it can be proposed by the President of the Commission and we abstain from voting in that case. Objectively I think it would be the best avenue, but it would need the change in national legislation and therefore we have to address the governments. They have to create the preconditions, not only in the case of Germany as I have explained but maybe also in other countries - that maybe will be the most difficult part of our report because then we deal with our own positions so to say and may be a little delicate. Nevertheless there is no way in my view to avoid this question if we want to go further into a new, so to say, quality of co-ordination. What we have now is a very close ex post information, maybe a close communication, exchange of information and views, but we have not reached the point where we really take common decision and that is of course a new quality which has far reaching consequences. I wonder how that can be described in a reasonable way, if we could come out with something like that I think we would have done a good job, but that would be in my view as I said the most difficult part of it. Excuse me for being a little lengthy, but I wanted to help our rapporteurs.","What we do now where we are is that we discuss and we inform each other of the situation in different institutions. First, the Committee in Basel - and you will remember that I have very often explained what the environment for monetary policy in Germany is and I have gone as far as I could. Another institution is for instance the G7 where we also have the same problem, where we discuss the matters but I am not in a position and neither is the Finance Minister - he is even less in a position - to make any ex ante commitment on monetary policy, legally. This was one of the reasons for the troubles we had and for the misunderstandings. Another institution, a very recent one, is the German-French Council on economic and fiscal policy where we have the same problem. All that I am going to say is only that we have to tell the Council that if they want a closer ex ante co-operation, consultation - which I think is absolutely necessary, I am in favour of that, I am not against it - then it needs a change in national legislation. That is, in the case of Germany but maybe in other countries as well, maybe you have similar problems or different problems.

Since I have the floor, Mr. Chairman, with your permission maybe I could say a few more words on the procedure of our work because I think we have had now 6 or 8 hours of discussion in our group and we are expected to make some concrete proposals, or proposals for concrete steps, in the direction of economic and monetary union. The time I think is beginning to run. I ask myself how can we proceed, how can we go ahead? I have sent you these papers just as a kind of material, as an analytical paper not as proposals - there are practically no proposals in those papers. Maybe it is useful for the rapporteurs and for you as well just to clarify the problems and to analyse the very complicated issue. I do not expect that these papers would become the raw material for the final report. What I would suggest is that we ask our rapporteurs to prepare a first draft for report as soon as possible. It should in my view contain maybe three parts.

1. A description, so to say, of the final stage, because I think it is good after so many partly confusing discussions to have a clear picture of what we are aiming for. What is the final objective? My feeling is that it wouldn't be so difficult to make a draft of that kind because at least amongst ourselves there is - that is my impression at least - some agreement on how economic and monetary union should look finally. I don't want to go into too much detail but I think we all agree that it should be a system with free capital movements, with free movement for goods and services and people and capital as well, it should be a system with stable prices and sufficient growth, etc. We have to say a word about the relations of this system with the outside world, in other words, what kind of exchange rate policy can we envisage in the final system? My answer would be domestic price stability, we should have the first priority versus exchange rate stability. In other words we should not put all the emphasis on exchange rate stability, we should stress more the necessity of price stability, etc. In this context the final stage in the first chapter: I think we also agree that a certain degree of fiscal harmonisation is necessary, as much as necessary but not more than necessary. It should be a federalistic, decentralised system. We also certainly agree that some kind of common monetary policy is necessary in an economic and monetary union with fixed exchange rates and free capital movements.

La seule chose que je voudrais dire pour les rapporteurs c'est que ça serait très intéressant d'avoir la gradation complète entre un et trois. Je voudrais pas que le rapport fasse une description un peu idyllique dans le chapitre premier de l'idéal et puis qu'il y ait un trop grand ?, une trop grande différence, entre les ""concrete steps"" que vous avez décrit dans le chapitre trois. Je crois qu'il faut fournir aux Chefs d'états une vue de ce que serait techniquement et légalement l'ensemble du système, ? ensuite à revenir beaucoup précisément dans les premiers pas. Ca c'était une observation que je voulais faire, ça ne change rien à ce qui a été dit. Une deuxième observation c'est que je crois qu'il faut que les aspects institutionnels, traité, pas traité, qu'est-ce qu'il faut donner aux institutions, qu'est-ce-qu'il faut donner à ce pouvoir économique dont on sent bien qu'il faut créer au niveau européen et le doter en tous cas de plus de forces, comment résoudre ce problème sur le plan institutionnel? Enfin une troisième petite annotation, je pense qu'il faut commencer dans cette structure monétaire à avoir concrètement des responsabilités, même modestes, mais à les avoir déjà en quelque sorte sous la main dans les premiers stades.","I am totally in harmony with the essence of what you said, I have no major problems on any of the points you have mentioned - perhaps differences in nuance but no major problems. The only thing I would say to the rapporteurs is that it would be very interesting to have the complete gradation between one and three. I would not that the report describes some idyllic in the first chapter of the ideal and then there is too much?, Too much difference between the ""concrete steps"" you described in chapter three. I believe we must provide the Heads of State a view of what would be technically and legally the whole system? then back much precisely the first steps. It was an observation I wanted to do, it does not change what has been said. A second observation is that I think we have the institutional, treated, untreated, what is to be given to institutions, what does he have to give this power economic which we feel that we must create at European level and provide the in any case more forces, how to solve this problem at the institutional level? Finally, a third small note, I think we should start in this monetary structure actually have responsibilities, even modest, but have already somehow on hand in the early stages."

2,10/10/1988,OK,,"T, B",100,Mr. M. Boyer,Miguel Boyer,1865 - 1925,1865,1925,60,2,1,,FR,"M. le Président je crois que le schéma qui a été demandé par le Gouverneur Pöhl c'est un schéma qui doit satisfaire les cheminements et les préoccupations que nous avons tous. Je veux simplement parler de deux choses.

1. Par rapport au stade final, qu'on est d'accord de décrire, nous avons très peu parlé aujourd'hui du problème des balances des paiements et même il a été annoncé dans le schéma des rapporteurs, dans une union monétaire économique complète les balances des paiements nationales n'ont plus aucune importance, ce qui est un peu exagéré je pense. C'est à dire que cela signifie que finalement des pays en excédent vont investir sûrement ou assurément dans les pays en déficit, mais si cela est automatique probablement il n'y aurait pas eu de crise de pétrole, des pays qui ont un excédent vont investir il n'y aurait pas un manque de demande globale, etc. C'est à dire le problème n'est pas aussi simple. On n'a pas parlé s'il y a une contrainte quelconque qui doit se superposer au marché pour qu'il n'y ait pas des excédents et des déficits structurels, est-ce qu'il n'est pas un billet ?? Simplement je note qu'on n'a pas parlé du problème des équilibres de balance des paiements mais qu'on a peut-être un peu trop ? dit à un moment donné les balances des paiements ça n'a aucune importance - c'est un peu je crois optimiste.

Ensuite je reprends une question que vous avez posé, M. le Président. Il se peut qu'il y ait deux cas différents à l'issue du rapport - les pays qui ne vont pas accepter l'union économique et monétaire, et des pays qui vont l'accepter soit en souscrivant à la vitesse générale soit en demandant des calendriers d'adaptation. Est-ce-que cela veut dire qu'on devrait, dans le mode de raisonnement du rapport, ne pas trop faire dépendre de l'acceptation du stade final et développer certaines étapes parce que c'est ? justifie ou non? Je pense par exemple que même sans accepter l'union économique monétaire finale - ce qui peut arriver pour certains pays, je ne crois pas que ce serait le cas par exemple de l'Espagne - certains pays peuvent dire qu'ils ne souscrivent pas aux transferts de souveraineté etc. Est-ce que, par exemple, dans ce cas un pays n'accepterait pas qu'il faut renforcer l'autonomie des banques centrales, est-ce qu'on ne va pas raisonner ? étant donné les problèmes que nous aurons dans les années prochaines, etc., est-ce qu'il n'est pas justifiable de penser qu'on doit s’acheminer vers une indépendance des banques centrales? Je crains que si tout le monde n'est pas d'accord dans l'étape finale, on utilise ce désaccord envers l‘étape finale pour rejeter les étapes intermédiaires. Est-ce-qu'il ne faut pas justifier jusqu'à la limite les étapes intermédiaires par elles-mêmes en disant qu'en plus elles s'acheminent vers un objectif que certains vont accepter? Je pense qu'il serait plus prudent de non pas faire tout dépendre de l'acceptation du but final, parce que certaines étapes sont au soutien (?) et son raisonnable d'indépendance.","Mr. President, I think the scheme that has been requested by the Governor Pöhl is a pattern that must meet pathways and concerns that we all have. I just want to mention two things.

1. Compared to the final stage, we agree to describe, we have very little spoken today of the balance of payments problem and even it was announced in the scheme of the rapporteurs, in full economic monetary union balances of national payments did not matter, which is a bit much I think. That is, it means that finally the surplus countries will surely invest or certainly in the deficit countries, but if it is automatic there probably would have been no oil crisis, countries that have a surplus will invest there would not be a lack of aggregate demand, etc. That is, the problem is not as simple. We did not talk if any constraint that must be superimposed on the market so that there are no surpluses and structural deficits, is that it is not a ticket ?? I note simply that we have not talked about the problem of balance of payments equilibrium, but we may have a little too much? said at some point the balance of payments it does not matter - it's a little I think optimism.

Then I take a question you asked, Mr. President. It may be that there are two different cases at the end of the report - the countries that will not accept the economic and monetary union, and the countries that will accept either by subscribing to general speed or by asking adaptation schedules. Do-it means that we should, in the report of reasoning, not too much depend on the acceptance of the final stage and develop certain steps because this is? justified or not? I think for example that even without accepting the final monetary economic union - which can happen in some countries, I do not think that would be the case for example of Spain - some countries may say they do not subscribe to transfers of sovereignty etc. Is, for example, in this case a country would not accept the need to strengthen the independence of central banks, are we not going to argue? given the problems we have in the coming years, etc., is that it is not justifiable to think that we should move towards a central bank independence? I fear that if everyone does not agree in the final step, use this disagreement with the final step to reject the intermediate steps. Do-it should not justify to the limit intermediate steps themselves by saying that the more they are moving towards a goal that some will accept? I think it would be prudent to not do all depend on the acceptance of the final goal, because some steps are the support (?) And reasonable independence."

2,10/10/1988,OK,,"T, B",102,M. A. Lamfalussy,Alexandre Lamfalussy,2012 - 2068,2012,2068,56,2,1,,FR,"Je voudrais revenir un instant sur les aspects institutionnels, cette remarque m'a été suggérée par une question qui a été posé par Karl-Otto Pöhl au sujet de l'autonomie des banques centrales. Je me place au stade final et pas du tout dans les étapes intermédiaires. Je crois que nous sommes tous d‘accord pour dire que quand il s'agit de la coordination ou de l'harmonisation des politiques budgétaires il faut probablement un dosage subtil entre le traité et le fonctionnement discrétionnaire d'une institution ou la négociation dans un cas institutionnel, que prévoir que le traité précise les modalités mais que chaque année les gouvernements concernés se mettent autour d'une table, regardent la situation macro-économique globale, fixent des objectifs, et que les écarts par rapport à l'objectif général soient limités en termes de traité. On peut prévoir une mécanique de ce genre dont l'avantage est qu'elle ne touche pas la souveraineté nationale, parce qu'il y aura un traité et dans le cas de ce traité les gouvernements ce concertent et se mettent d'accord. Quand on en arrive à la politique monétaire la situation est tout à fait différente, en ce sens qu'en matière de politique monétaire, dans le cas d'une union monétaire, il ne faut pas une simple coordination de politiques il faut une politique monétaire, fondamentalement - c'est une première différence. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de nuances là, en matière budgétaire il y a des battements, il y a des nuances, en matière de politique monétaire il n'y a pas de nuances. Deuxième chose, ce n'est pas une affaire d'une décision qui peut être prénegociée une fois par an. La politique monétaire se fait au jour le jour et surtout dans un monde extrêmement mouvant à la fois à l'intérieur des pays et dans un contexte international. Donc pour la politique monétaire il faut qu'il y ait un organe qui prenne des décisions de façon continue. Alors je vois mal comment cet organe puisse exister autrement que dans le cadre d'une certaine autonomie des banques centrales, parce que si cette autonomie n'est pas assurée l'organe en question doit se référer aux gouvernements. Alors s’il commence à se référer aux gouvernements il n’y aura pas de politique monétaire commune, vous ne pouvez pas gérer une politique monétaire en disant nous mettons d'accord autour d'une table, par  exemple, ? des gouverneurs peu importe par voie majoritaire et puis on rentre ? et on demande à son gouvernement est-ce-que vous aimez ça ou pas? Ce n'est pas possible de faire la politique monétaire sur cette base. Il y a une différence très nette entre ce que les exigences institutionnelles sont à matière fiscale, budgétaire, il ne faut pas viser l'abandon de souveraineté parce que ce n'est pas possible et ce n'est même pas nécessaire. Tandis qu'en matière monétaire c'est un autre jeu. Ce n'est pas tellement pour faire plaisir aux banques centrales et pour avoir une politique monétaire qu'il faut une certaine forme d'autonomie et moi je mettrais l'accent sur cette exigence-là.","I would go back for a moment on the institutional aspects, the remark was suggested to me by a question that was posed by Karl Otto Pohl about the autonomy of central banks. I stand at the final stage and not at all in the middle rounds. I think we all agree that when it comes to coordination or harmonization of fiscal policies should probably be a delicate balance between the treaty and the discretionary function of an institution or trading in a institutional cases, provide that the Treaty specifies how but each year the governments concerned sit around a table, watching the overall macroeconomic situation, set goals, and the deviations from the general objective are limited in terms of the Treaty. Provision may be mechanical like that which has the advantage that it does not affect national sovereignty, because there will be a treaty and in the case of this treaty that governments consult and agree. When it comes to monetary policy the situation is quite different in the sense that monetary policy in the case of a monetary union, it must not be a mere coordination of policies we need a monetary policy basically - it's a first difference. There are not many nuances here in budgetary matters there are beats, there are nuances in monetary policy there are no nuances. Second thing, it is not a matter of a decision that can be pre-negotiated annually. Monetary policy is day to day and especially in a highly volatile world both within the country and in the international context. So for monetary policy there must be a body that take continuously decisions. So I do not see how this body can exist otherwise than as part of a certain autonomy of central banks, because if this autonomy is not assured the body in question must refer to governments. Then he begins to see the governments there will be no common monetary policy, you can not run a monetary policy saying we agree around a table, for example? Governors matter by majority track and then we go? and asked his government-is it you like it or not? It is not possible to make monetary policy on this basis. There is a clear difference between what the institutional requirements are fiscal, budgetary, do not refer to the abandonment of sovereignty because it's not possible and it is not even necessary. While in the monetary field it's another game. It is not so much to please the central banks for monetary policy need some form of autonomy and I would emphasize this requirement there."

I think our discussion this morning and this afternoon really has established a lot of common ground. To this extent institutionally also this brings me back to the point that you were raising yourself, Mr. Chairman, earlier about a need for a treaty or alternatively institutional strengthening. I am not sure, I have to say, that I see those as alternatives but I think while we are all agreed that parallel progress has to be made on strengthening monetary policy, fiscal policy, regional policy, incomes policy, the real difficulty is assuming the will to make this kind of progress that these policies are institutionally based in different places and on institutions which have not the same strength of purpose or, indeed, of possibility of action. Monetary policy, I think, has advanced further than any monetary policy co-ordination - if I can put it that way - of these others, partly because it is easier in a technical sense to define what it is you ought to be doing - or has been might be a better way of putting it - for historical reasons, but also there is a convenient and ready-made institution, namely the Committee of Governors, to which you can act. That is not so clear in the case of the other policies. I don't think we need new institutions, there are enough institutions in Europe to manage anything that needs to be done, but what I think may need to be done is to enable the institutions that are there to act with the same effectiveness as the Committee of Governors is capable of doing, even if it hasn't yet done so. One of the reasons that monetary policy has come further than the others so far and one of the reasons that I fear monetary policy might be forced to carry a larger burden in the future is because it is easier to point the finger when something goes on. The Ministers when presenting the unhappy, or at least unpleasant, results and some of the results are bound to be unpleasant, of progress towards economic and monetary union would certainly feel happier if they were able to say that is the result of monetary policy co-ordination and that has been carried out by central banks. They are not going to have the same incentive to co-ordinate their fiscal policies unless they are forced to - or maybe to put it better - unless they can point to a force within Europe which gives them much less latitude in the options open to them. The same, by the way, goes for co-ordination of regional policies and incomes policies, I have no doubt about that. All of that suggests to me that the weight of progress in the future has to lie in the direction of treaty amendments because that then gives a firm anchoring point for everybody. It closes down the options for escape and I think that is terribly important because there is not enough ? to will where you want to go or to will your decisions, you also have to will the consequences of your decisions. It would be very easy to produce a report which enabled the heads of state to say, yes, that is where we want to go and then to think bank into the existing morass of evasions and difficulties and impossibilities of doing anything about it just yet. That is why I must say, while I haven't a firm view on it, I am clear enough in my mind on one thing, firstly, I think we have enough institutions; secondly, I think those institutions need strengthening if you are going to make any progress; and thirdly, I don't think that you are going to strengthen those institutions sufficiently unless you have firm treaty commitments to do so.","Just to add to what Governor Ciampi has said with most of which I must say I agree. I think our discussion this morning and this afternoon really has established a lot of common ground. To this extent institutionally also this brings me back to the point that you were raising yourself, Mr. Chairman, earlier about a need for a treaty or alternatively institutional strengthening. I am not sure, I have to say, that I see those as alternatives but I think while we are all agreed that parallel progress has to be made on strengthening monetary policy, fiscal policy, regional policy, incomes policy, the real difficulty is assuming the will to make this kind of progress that these policies are institutionally based in different places and on institutions which have not the same strength of purpose or, indeed, of possibility of action. Monetary policy, I think, has advanced further than any monetary policy co-ordination - if I can put it that way - of these others, partly because it is easier in a technical sense to define what it is you ought to be doing - or has been might be a better way of putting it - for historical reasons, but also there is a convenient and ready-made institution, namely the Committee of Governors, to which you can act.

Si chaque gouverneur veut demander à un expert de son pays une note de ? sur la politique de son pays en matière de correction des équilibres régionaux nous en ferons ensuite un ? et une synthèse, ça c'est à vous de juger, c'est pour vous faciliter la tâche. Mais bien entendu si nous avions du temps devant nous il serait de beaucoup préférable que chaque pays établisse ...

On va avoir un énième rapport, ces choses existent déjà. Je crois qu'il faut centrer cette analyse sur la substantifique moëlle que nous voulons tirer. Quelle est la substantifique moëlle que nous voulons tirer? Je crois que c'est la suivante. Il y a un certain nombre de pays qui sont engagés dans un processus d'union économique et monétaire dans la Communauté, certains d'entre eux ont des problèmes régionaux qui sont en fait des problèmes nationaux, d'autres ont des problèmes régionaux qui ne sont que régionaux, et la question que posent les pays qui sont à eux seuls un problème régional ont, en abandonnant la souveraineté monétaire, c'est à dire la possibilité d'adapter nos songes, nous nous retirons, nous nous privons, d'un instrument d'ajustement pour nous fondamental, comment allons-nous remplacer cela et quelle est la part que des politiques de correction par voie de transferts, quelle est la part que nous pouvons attendre de ces politiques? C'est là que le rapporteur, à mon avis, doit jouer un rôle parce qu'il peut nous dire quelle est l'échelle des problèmes régionaux qu'on a rencontré dans différents pays de la Communauté? Qu'est-ce que ça représente la politique française d'aménagement du territoire en pourcentage de PIB pour la France? En quoi une politique d'aménagement du territoire en Irlande représente à la fois en termes irlandais et en termes de la Commanauté? Donc il faut essayer de lui trouver un mandat précis de travail, pas simplement ajouter 12 législations nationales. Enfin, c'est un sujet difficile ...","That's really as wished. If every governor wants to ask an expert of his country a note? on the policy of his country in correcting regional balances then we'd be? and synthesis, that's for you to judge, it is for your convenience. But of course if we have time before us it would be far better for each country to ... (end of Tape 2, Side 1) ... but not to stack all legislation on spatial planning, the subsidies to depressed areas in our country. We will have yet another report, these things already exist. I think we should focus on this analysis substantific marrow that we shoot. What is the marrow substantific we want to shoot? I think it is this. There are a number of countries engaged in a process of economic and monetary union in the Community, some of them have regional problems which are in fact national problems, others have regional problems that as are regional and the question posed by countries which are in themselves have a regional problem, abandoning monetary sovereignty, ie the right to adapt our dreams, we retire, we deprive ourselves, to an adjustment instrument for fundamental us, how will we replace it and what part that corrective policies through transfers, what part can we expect of these policies? This is where the rapporteur, in my opinion, should play a role because it can tell us what is the scale of regional problems we encountered in different countries of the Community? What does it mean the French policy planning in GDP percentage for France? What a policy of regional development in Ireland represents both Irish terms and in terms of Commanauté?

Godeaux,Jean Godeaux,110 - 247,110,247,137,1,1,,EN,"Mr. President, in my paper I did a few times sin against the English language for which I apologise, I also sinned against the necessary brevity, but I believe that on the whole I was - attempted at any rate to be - objective and balanced and pointed out what we have achieved, what remains to be achieved, and therefore I suppose that I can in this informal meeting state more explicitly than I did in my paper what I believe can be the next step for the future. Of course, in my paper you might say that in ""coda venimen"", because what is important in my view is the last page where I say ""although the present strategy of voluntary policy co-ordination undoubtedly still leaves room for ample improvement, the question arises how long such a stance can continue meeting the increasing requirements of joint monetary policy-making and can remain a satisfactory answer to the expectations of market operators, of public opinion and of the political sphere"". Then I said ""not only must progress be made but it must be seen to be made"", which means personally that either we are in a position to have a new Basle/Nyborg package, if that is what we prefer along the pragmatic lines, and I realise that when I say a new Basle/Nyborg package it is not so easy to define and we are faced with - let's put it frankly - when our German colleagues made a great effort to make the Basle/Nyborg package possible, they did say - I still hear Karl-Otto Pöhl saying - now we must get rid of this problem for a number of years. But I believe that if we choose the pragmatic approach we must be able to put together some visible new package of measures. Alternatively, we may have an institutional step along the lines, for instance, that Jacques de Larosière has suggested, something that is not even a European Monetary Fund, that would not go to the extent that we have given up, which is the institutional phase of the EMS. I said in my paper that nobody really expects us to make the second step - the institutional step - of the EMS when it was drafted in 1979. What could be this institutional progress? It seems to me at any rate that, in view of the expectations of our public opinions, of our governments, we must be able to achieve something visible, even though I am convinced that what we do between ourselves is very effective, is pregnant with much progress. The question then is what should be the content of an institutional step, or would be the content of a new Basle/Nyborg package? I believe that the content should be that we must try to have ex ante co-ordination more than ex post as we have had in the past. Secondly, I believe that we should have in the same lines, pre-co-ordinated interventions. That seems to me to be the inside of that. For the smaller central banks of the Twelve, for instance, we are often impressed by the fact that we hear afterwards what is the conclusion that, for instance, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank of England, the Banque de France have drawn from the higher meetings and though it can be felt by the Bundesbank, for instance, that it is a hindrance to have a larger co-ordination before action, I think it would be an essential theme. I believe that - and that is difficult to make visible - that further ""rapprochement"" of our monitoring exercise. As the President, I was impressed by the fact today, for instance, that we saw how much Governors were interested by the idea that we would have a Raymond exercise more frequently and that monthly monitoring should be a combination of the exchange dealers' approach and the economists' approach. Then I add this, knowing that this shall not please Karl-Otto - he may consider it as a non possimus - I believe that the next progress we could make would be in the diversification of reserves in our respective central banks and it would mean that, under some conditions and with limitations that would have to be invented, in case flows of funds do create tensions in the EMS because funds that flow out of dollar assets come into DM assets, a sort of recycling should exist and it would have to mean that the Deutsche Bundesbank would accept that part of its reserves would be held in other European currencies. I realise, of course, that many of our currencies, if they are in the package of reserves that must be used by the Bundesbank for intervention, are less usable and therefore they are not a progress, but I suppose there is a certain part that can be considered as reserves that can be held for a longer time and is not necessarily likely to be used for interventions.

This is what I said in order to start the ball rolling, and I will sum it up again. I believe that pragmatic co-operation as we have and which is very useful, must in our report acquire a certain visibility, we must do something, announce something that can be seen. Secondly, that the choice is between an institutional step, a new institution with some definite responsibilities, or a Basle/Nyborg package that we could define together. When you ask me what I could conceivably put into this Basle/Nyborg package, I said a few things that I believe we can say, even though I am not quite sure that this can have a sufficiently high visibility, that it is not too technical, understandable only by central bankers and not by the public opinion - they will say what does it mean your monitoring with the Raymond and Dalgaard groups? I realise that is difficult.

I must say that I align myself more easily with the original stance of Jean Godeaux than with either President Pöhl or Jacques de Larosière in dismissing the sort of points that Jean Godeaux has made for us earlier on as being an important part of our report. We have acknowledged I think that Chapter I is going to describe the present situation and the progress that we have made. I think at some stage it is perfectly legitimate to point out to Heads of State the sort of progress we could continue to make without institutional or treaty changes. After all, pointing that out could have the modest practical merit that we could make some progress even if Heads of States are unable to agree on any of the rest of our proposals - let's hope that that is not so. There is that merit, I think, in the sort of points that Governor Godeaux has made. The discussion is immediately pointed up, of course, the point at which institutional change has to be made. I suppose one could describe that as the point at which maybe we crystallise events by seeking some sort of treaty change. My own feeling is that we have to be very clear in our minds about what we are doing before we actually do recommend or negotiate, or succeed in obtaining, a treaty change. I am inclined to think that we need to get used to what we have developed under Basle/Nyborg, building on that where we see a need, and also getting used to the changes in our environment that 1992 will bring, before we can really clearly see what form of institutional change will be needed to achieve the eventual goal of economic and monetary union. It seems to me important to retain some flexibility about the form of monetary union and how to get there. Of course it is sensible to set out the intended course, but to make sure that we don't hinder changes to that course that might come to be seen as necessary in the light of experience. I would like to suggest that treaty amendment should not take place earlier than is absolutely necessary. It seems to me that we can take important early steps, such as greater ex ante co-ordination of policy which do not treaty amendment, in contrast to which treaty change - at this stage at least - might be a form of Pandora's box.

Let us go back to Governor de Larosière's paper, which presents a very useful step-wise approach and also allows I think for a learning process. I don't know that it is absolutely essential that we need to have a learning process of this nature, and I hope he won't mind it if I say that we need to be careful that we are not creating some sort of part-time central bank and then looking around for tasks for it to carry out until we have really reached the stage of proper monetary union. Could I suggest, Mr. Chairman, that the time to set up the institutional framework is once there is the political will for it to do a real job and to achieve something that national central banks jointly and severally cannot do. Could I put this way, in the form of a question, at what point does a centralised foreign exchange or money-market function provide added value, that is value over and above what can be achieved jointly and severally by national central banks? Governor de Larosière's proposal is an extremely interesting one, but will it be able to function effectively alongside national central banks who simultaneously it would appear will be continuing to operate their own monetary policy and may also simultaneously be operating their own exchange rate policy? It may be that the existence of this intermediate body will reinforce the processes of national central banks, in which case it will be a step in the right direction. If actually it is always reinforcing those policy actions by the national central banks, we have almost reached total union. If we have not then it seems to me that there will always be dangers of counter policies coming from one or other national central bank as against what the European Reserve Fund - or whatever title it may have - is undertaking. It may be that we can avoid such conflict between national banks and the European Monetary Fund, if so we will have very nearly got to total union.","Thank you Mr. Chairman.

3,11/8/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",131,M. A. Lamfalussy,Alexandre Lamfalussy,662 - 825,662,825,163,1,1,,EN,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to make a few observations, which were inspired by reading Jean Godeaux’s report and Jacques de Larosière's proposal, and I think I will try to raise a few questions and try to answer some of them, not all of them certainly at this stage. As I see it the first practical step - and I am talking about that and not about the final stage - its main objective should be what I think Jean Godeaux described, especially here today, namely that somehow we should move from what I may call ex post information on policies and very occasional ex ante information or ex ante attempt of co-ordination towards something that is more explicitly ex ante co-ordination of policies in two fields - monetary policy and exchange market intervention. These are clearly two interconnected areas, on the one hand monetary policy is the single most important short-term determinant of exchange rates - it is not the exclusive determinant but the single most important short-term determinant of exchange rates - and secondly, exchange market intervention unless it is completely sterilised has an automatic impact on domestic monetary policy. The two areas are interconnected and that is why I very strongly approve Jacques de Larosière's approach of dealing with these two simultaneously because they are interconnected. You may have views on which should precede which and how to organise it, but the two have to happen together in some sense because they are functionally interconnected. If this could be regarded as the objective of the first step - moving from ex post more to ex ante co-ordination - then the next most important question is with what degree of institutional set-up? My own answer is that we need some institutional arrangement. Theoretically speaking, of course, in both these fields you could imagine that the Committee of the Governors could suddenly decide that until now we have talked to each other about policies and now we decide to consult each other before the policies. I think this is conceivable but it is not a very practical thing to do, it would not be credible at all to the public because the first question the people would ask is why is it that you haven't done it so far? Secondly, you would run into a number of other difficulties concerning the other participants in the policy measures, which are Ministries or Treasuries, in varying degrees of institutional commitment in the various countries. I think we need some sort of institutional arrangement for that but that, of course, raises all the thorny questions that have not yet been addressed, i.e. what does it mean in terms of legislative changes; what does it mean in terms of procedures; how can one, nevertheless, respect the autonomy of decision-making on a national level, etc.?

The next step of my observations concerns I think a very important difference I would introduce between monetary policy co-ordination process and intervention co-ordination process, and there is I think one basic very important difference which can be very easily seen if I take the example of today. I didn't attend your meeting this morning but I know more or less what has happened and I know what the views are. Clearly we are moving towards a very favourable economic development in practically all of our countries, there may be dangers of overheating in some of the countries and that clearly could be an argument in favour of some monetary restraint. That is something that probably could be the outcome of an analysis of today and then the question immediately arises, well how should this be done in advance, can we look at it in such a way that one doesn't do too much and the other doesn't do too little? This is an objective thing that can be discussed in these circumstances and one could then try to get some sort of agreement, covering the next two, three, four months, that one looks ahead. If you look at the exchange rate situation, whilst you can make some guesses you can make no more than guesses, no-one knows what the dollar is going to do even in half an hour - whether it goes up or down - and it is very difficult to have any sort of peacefully concerted advance concertation about intervention policies. I think one has to treat these two areas in a rather different way.

Let me start with monetary policy for two reasons, partly because I believe that it is perhaps less daunting to imagine some sort of ex ante co-ordination, and also because I think in a certain sense it is the underlying problem for exchange rate determination. I don't want to put on the table any particular suggestion as to how this could be done, but I think you need some sort of institutional weight behind it, there ought to be some sort of agreement which has to be reached, which need not be shared by everyone but which should be known and should be brought to the attention of the national authorities. How you do that is something one has to look into.

When I come to the exchange market intervention part that is to my mind a much harder nut to crack. There are several reasons. I do agree that the approach taken by Jacques de Larosière is an interesting one and probably - but I would like to reserve my judgment - the most practical I can imagine at this stage, because this sort of institutional set-up has an image effect, there is no doubt about it, or a signal effect, call it whatever you may, and of course it provides also a training ground for effective co-operation. It does raise a number of very difficult questions to answer. The first series of questions are really, you may call them technical questions, but they are extremely important in their practical effects and quite - for obvious reasons Jacques de Larosière didn't consider them because that was not yet the stage - but I may perhaps mention two or three of these practical questions that arise.

If you have a pooling of reserves what do the central banks get against the reserves which they sell to the joint institution? Are you going to get ECUs or what? Is it a sort of ? type of arrangement or the FECOM type of arrangement but in a final sense and not in a swap sense? This is not a minor question because all central banks are interested to know if they sell some of their reserves what they get in exchange, I think that is a fairly normal preoccupation. The answer you give to that question can have a number of very important impacts on the working of the institution itself.

Another question that arises immediately, and it follows from the answer you would give to the first question, is about the working of the profit and loss mechanism of the pooled reserves. How do you share out the profits and the losses, because there will be both, probably in a certain sequence?

These things can be written down and analysed very coolly and has to be done. I am not suggesting these are insuperable questions but of course they have to be dealt with.

Then I come to the second group of questions which to my mind I don't quite frankly see the answers. That is the decision-making process and the degree of competence of the managers or of the joint management of these pooled reserves in the field of intervention. You can imagine two sorts of options. You can imagine that the pooled reserves and the intervention carried out by these pooled reserves happen in a sort of agency function, that somehow the governors or the central banks give instructions to this reserve centre to carry out intervention, in addition to what they have decided themselves anyhow. Whatever you do in this respect does raise the very difficult question of the technical speed of the intervention decisions. Here is the point that I wanted to make: while you can look ahead for monetary policy co-ordination on a longer perspective, you cannot talk about any practical intervention unless you are ready to explain who takes what decision and with what speed. You may give broad indications but these broad indications usually reveal themselves as being completely unrealistic the next day, so one has to tackle the practical problem in that respect. You could imagine then to leave to this fund a certain autonomy of decision-making in the intervention, but if you do that then you come up with the following alternative. Either you give them genuine autonomy for $x billion, in which case you come up immediately against the barrier of domestic monetary policy because if you intervene in dollars you have to buy something or sell something against and you will disturb either the Deutsche Mark or the Dutch guilder or someone else, and that creates immediately a domestic monetary problem. Or else you can do it for very small amounts and you say well the amounts are so small that they don't really disturb domestic monetary policy, but then what is the purpose of the operation? These are very difficult questions to settle and I frankly at this stage don't see the answer, although I have an instinctive sympathy for the idea of the institutional approach, because if you don't do it on an institutional basis the danger is that you don't do anything at all. As a practitioner, which is the hat I am wearing at the moment, I wanted to put these preoccupations on the table.","Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to make a few observations, which were inspired by reading Jean Godeaux’s report and Jacques de Larosière's proposal, and I think I will try to raise a few questions and try to answer some of them, not all of them certainly at this stage. As I see it the first practical step - and I am talking about that and not about the final stage - its main objective should be what I think Jean Godeaux described, especially here today, namely that somehow we should move from what I may call ex post information on policies and very occasional ex ante information or ex ante attempt of co-ordination towards something that is more explicitly ex ante co-ordination of policies in two fields - monetary policy and exchange market intervention. These are clearly two interconnected areas, on the one hand monetary policy is the single most important short-term determinant of exchange rates - it is not the exclusive determinant but the single most important short-term determinant of exchange rates - and secondly, exchange market intervention unless it is completely sterilised has an automatic impact on domestic monetary policy. The two areas are interconnected and that is why I very strongly approve Jacques de Larosière's approach of dealing with these two simultaneously because they are interconnected. You may have views on which should precede which and how to organise it, but the two have to happen together in some sense because they are functionally interconnected. If this could be regarded as the objective of the first step - moving from ex post more to ex ante co-ordination - then the next most important question is with what degree of institutional set-up? My own answer is that we need some institutional arrangement. Theoretically speaking, of course, in both these fields you could imagine that the Committee of the Governors could suddenly decide that until now we have talked to each other about policies and now we decide to consult each other before the policies.

3,11/8/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",133,Dr. W.F. Duisenberg,Wim Duisenberg,904 - 1005,904,1005,101,1,1,,EN,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. A few statements. The end which we are striving for is economic and monetary union and I am in full support of that. One of the main characteristics of that we also agreed is that the task of a monetary authority in that context is the promotion of price stability, i.e. external price stability, exchange rates and internal price stability, and we should never forget that. I think also that these two - external and internal - can never be split, you cannot go after the one forgetting about the other. What we are discussing now, and I think there is a real difference in approach under the surface at least, is how to get there - the steps. One approach - Governor de Larosière’s approach I think to be very specific - is the way of transfer, of partial instruments (partial transfer of instruments, i.e. intervention mechanisms partially, maybe even interest rates partially) to a central body (maybe governed by governors or part of the governors), but it is a partial transfer of instruments. The other way it seems to me, and that is the way which has my support, is that of increasing centralisation of the decision-taking on general monetary policy, that includes exchange rate policy and domestic policy, but increased centralisation of decision-taking. In the words of M. Lamfalussy what we have now is ex post information, sometimes ex ante information, sometimes even as he said efforts to ex ante co-ordination, but not more than that. Then it seems to me there is something artificial in not discussing what steps the governors could take further on and what steps would require decisions by governments and institutional changes. I think there is a gradual process also there.

The reasons I am not very much in favour - not at all if I am honest - of the first avenue of partial transfer of instruments are the following. It is impossible to think of making interventions by other bodies than the national central bank or decisions on interest rates with a view towards exchange rate manipulation, without having that implications for the room for manoeuvre for domestic monetary policy and domestic interest rate movements. Interventions have money market consequences and most of the time they are only effective if they are also accompanied by interest rate measures and both are of utmost importance for the behaviour of the growth of the money supply, for example. Then you come to the goal of price stability, in other words I do not believe in a sort of dichotomy, a split between measures or instruments with an external impact and those with an exclusively internal impact on money supply and interest rates. In the proposals as we have before us, both M. de Larosière's proposals and also some of the thoughts of Mr. Thygesen, that is in first place as I said centralisation of instruments which are in the domain of the exchange rates, interventions and to a degree interest rates. That implies the danger as I see it that this central monetary authority or European Central Bank, or the nucleus thereof - whatever you might call it - puts the accent of its work, of its functioning, too much on the external side, exclusively on exchange rates, forgetting thereby the domestic, the internal, monetary implications which are also the results of the use of instruments in that.

So exclusively or too much external consideration might determine the policy and then the danger is large, as long as convergence of economic policies and economic performance has not been drastically improved and as long as exchange rates inside the system are not yet completely fixed, the risk is very large that the European authority would deviate, in my mind, too much from its central mandate, that is the promotion of price stability. I see a great danger there.

Therefore, to sum up, Mr. Chairman, partial transfer of instruments I think will not work, I would be in favour of increased centralisation of decision-taking in the monetary field in general and I do realise that also along that road you will very soon come up against the barriers that they also require institutional changes. If we move gradually in our work, also as a Committee of Governors, towards ex ante co-ordination and binding co-ordination of our policies, there also have to be institutional changes. It is unthinkable, for example let us take the three largest countries, that in the Committee of Governors we would agree that for the sake of price stability or exchange rate stability it would be desirable that in Germany the rates were to be lowered, in France they would remain unchanged and in the United Kingdom they would have to be raised. In all three cases I think to be very specific M. de Larosière would have to consult with his Minister of Finance and so would Governor Leigh-Pemberton and Governor Pöhl would say I agree with it, but it is the Zentralbankrat which makes the ultimate decision. In all three cases there would have to be a fall-back on the existing institutions in the various countries. So even ex ante co-ordination and binding co-ordination of policies would already imply institutional changes, be it by way of international treaty which supersedes the national legislation, be it by changing the respective positions and legal positions of the central banks and central bank governors involved. I think there is no escape in either approach, be it the partial instrumental approach or the approach of increased centralisation of powers, in both cases you would very soon come up against the necessity of having a treaty or at least institutional changes which would have to be underpinned by the treaty. As you notice I very much share the questions or at least the leading questions placed by M. Lamfalussy and given a choice I would be for intensification of the work of the Committee of Governors, realising that also there we would very soon have to go to our governments and say, well, if you want us to intensify our co-operative work further you will have to change the law.","Thank you Mr. Chairman.

3,11/8/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",134,M. J. de Larosière,Jacques de Larosière,1008 - 1080,1008,1080,72,1,1,,EN,"Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't think that there is so much of a gap between Mr. Duisenberg's concept and mine. Firstly, in my mind I am not at all thinking of a huge intervention machine - this has to be understood - it is not at all a matter of setting up an intervention fund which would upset domestic monetary conditions, that is not at all my idea. My idea is this. There is a G7 strategy, let us say vis-à-vis the dollar, it results in greater or smaller interventions, but anyway there is this strategy. My idea is not to innovate, my idea is to say, in addition to interventions undertaken by central banks - and this will happen in the majority of cases - one can practice on the basis of an understanding as to what the G7 strategy really means, one can practice in making marginal interventions which would go in the same sense as the main interventions as the central banks by using common reserves, and if one does that one would not upset the domestic monetary situation. If one upsets it one upsets it within the more general framework of what has already been ""upset"" by national authorities because it is really an annex to something which has already been done. Therefore I do not accept that with a huge intervention machine one is going to upset domestic monetary conditions.

There is a great advantage in doing what I am suggesting, at least as I see it. Firstly, there is this message which is sent out as a result of what we do now - maybe you don't like this idea, you don't want to show in a somewhat concrete manner that you are moving in the direction of a future European bank, then I understand that it would be better for my paper to be put into the wastepaper basket and to agree that we shall continue arranging things amongst ourselves. But if one wishes to tell Heads of State, you have asked us to think about a process leading towards European integration, then it is helpful to have some sort of an embryo which would get us to work together. Mr. Lamfalussy was right putting concrete questions, it would be easier at the beginning and probably, because of what he said at the beginning, one would be very timid, one is not going to intervene, for instance, on a day when there is a difference of interpretation between the main operators, one will act when there is already an underlying consensus. It is not a bad thing to do something, it helps one to learn how to work together and it does send out the signal. I like the questions asked by Mr. Lamfalussy because it will force a small group of people who know one another, who I think quite like one another - the heads of the dealing rooms - to work together and then to report to the governors. It is in this way that the Federal Reserve System started in 1913, it made a small start and, with due respect to what Mr. Leigh-Pemberton said earlier on, once it existed one has started hunting around for things for it to do. Therefore I am not at all upset by the stability objective suggested by Mr. Duisenberg, and he is also right to say that if you leave everything to co-ordination between central bankers at the Committee of Governors, you are going to run into this problem of differences of approach between central banks, the difficulty for them to work together a priori. Of course, I am going to allow Mr. Pöhl to talk, but accentuated co-ordination would pose constitutional problems for him. He has often told us that it is the Bundesbank's Council which reaches decisions and that one couldn't really hold lengthy consultations beforehand, therefore this problem will crop up. If we look at the institutional approach à la de Larosière and the practical approach of Mr. Duisenberg or Mr. Godeaux, if you look at all of this you will see that institutional problems will arise very soon and you will have to tackle them. Since you will have to tackle them anyway, why not make a start? Say that before we have these institutions we have to reinforce co-ordination within the Committee of Governors, yes alright, and I think that this strengthening will have to take place in any case, whether we do anything further or not, but this would not cause any philosophical difficulties for me. I look at this whole exercise in a pragmatic and modest manner, I do not place intervention at the heart of everything but I think it is not a bad thing to start working together.","Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't think that there is so much of a gap between Mr. Duisenberg's concept and mine.

3,11/8/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",139,Herrn K.-O. Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,1356 - 1535,1356,1535,179,1,1,,EN,"Mr. Chairman, I would like to come back to the question which was raised by Governor Hoffmeyer at the beginning, because I think that is the most important question, at least from a legal and institutional point of view, which we have to have in mind - the political reality in Europe. I fully agree with what he said, that we have to distinguish between two different models which I think we should propose to our principals. The one model is a model which needs a legal framework, call it a treaty, and in this context I think the proposals of both de Larosière and Thygesen belong, because both proposals, but particularly the one of Jacques de Larosière, could not be implemented without legal changes to the legislation in the member countries. Then I think one has to take seriously the argument which was put forward by Governor Hoffmeyer that you cannot set up a treaty, a framework for a European central bank system, step-by-step because it is not conceivable that you can change the laws, the treaty, every three years. That means, by definition, that gradualism is hardly conceivable. In my view it is unrealistic and not helpful at all if one would suggest that, because you would come up with a fund for intervention, maybe the best under the circumstances, with a small, little, body but that could easily be the end of it, it could be a failure anyway and there is no guarantee that that would really develop into a European central bank system finally. I think it would be much better to draft a design for such a treaty, for such a framework - I am very much in favour of that - and then one should go further than you did, one should really make it a complete European central bank system, defining the tasks, the instruments and the institutional body as a model and telling the Heads of State that this could be a European central bank system one day, but it needs, of course, a lot of further legal, economic, study, etc. because nobody I think is seriously expecting that the European governments or parliaments would be ready today to pass, to transfer, substantial sovereignty rights in this area to such an institution. On top of that you always have in mind that this is not enough, you can have that only if at the same time you have institutional provisions for co-ordinated economic policies, etc. That is a long-term perspective, very useful and necessary, but it cannot be implemented in the near future. That is the one part.

The other part is what can be done without institutional changes of this far-reaching kind. There are two groups, one is the one Jean Godeaux mentioned which already falls in the competence of the central bank governors or in the competence of the finance ministers. As far as fiscal policy is concerned, they have the opportunity to co-ordinate their fiscal policy. We have the possibility, to a certain extent at least, to co-ordinate our interventions in the exchange markets and actually we are doing that, our operators are in touch four times a day if I am not mistaken. There is a very close co-ordination and co-operation within the given framework and of course one can discuss other changes, the kinds Godeaux mentioned, e.g. diversification of reserves, etc. This is nothing we have to suggest and propose to the Council. There is a second group of changes which one could envisage without changing the law and without setting up a treaty which needs parliamentary approval and would be very very difficult to get through in all member countries - then you get the problem that it doesn't go through in all member countries and do we really want two groups, two classes of members, etc.? There is another kind of group and that is strengthening the existing institutions, in the first place and particularly from our point of view, the Council of Central Bank Governors. The Council of Central Bank Governors was set up in 1964 if I am not mistaken by a resolution of the Council, the Council of Ministers, like the FECOM by the way, and if you read the text you see that the tasks of the Committee are very clearly defined in that resolution and I wonder whether one shouldn't go a little more into that legal question of whether the tasks of the Committee as they are defined in the text could not be enlarged by a resolution of the Council, without changing national law and without affecting the competences of national monetary authorities. I think that is a very crucial point because there will be a lot of opposition in all countries to any change - in my country I could easily describe what would come close to a revolution if you would really try to reduce the so-called independence of the Council of the Bundesbank. They have the only right to decide on interest rates, etc., if that should be transferred to an institution in Basle, Strasbourg or Brussels or wherever, it would create a lot of problems. The same would happen in other countries where the finance ministers have that competence which they wouldn't like to transfer to this Committee. The utmost we can hope for is, maybe, at least we can propose it, that the Council of Governors would be strengthened and would get the authority to give recommendations to the national monetary authorities, be it the Central Bank Council in the case of Germany, or central bank plus finance ministry in other countries, giving recommendations in all areas which affect both price stability, monetary stability, exchange rate system, where we are in charge, particularly of course all questions which affect the management of the exchange rate mechanism or the EMS which as you know is our main task - the management of the exchange rate mechanism. So I could imagine that one could grate (?) the Council of Governors, maybe we call it the European Central Bank Council, an anomaly to the German, but that is already beginning to be a little delicate, but to give the whole thing, Jacques, a little more symbolic, more institutional meaning. Call it a European Central Bank Council, you have a Chairman who would be elected not only for one year but for three years and who could attend the meetings in Brussels, could get a little more profile, etc. and then this Council could give recommendations, let us say on monetary policy in the respective member countries of the EC, on economic and fiscal policy even, if it affects the exchange rate stability, price stability in the EEC. One example for that exercise was this morning, if we would be authorised to send a letter to the German Finance Minister telling him that the Governors have discussed that matter and a great majority came to the conclusion that higher indirect taxes in Germany are not fully consistent with the objective to reduce imbalances in the EMS, I think that would have some effect. .... I am not sure we have the authority to do that.

Other subjects would be intervention, Jacques, and there I come to your ideas. I don't think we need a fund because that would raise all the legal, institutional questions we have to answer if we set up a central bank system, for instance, to solve the questions of who takes the decisions, as M. Lamfalussy rightly mentioned - it is only one illustration - who takes the decision? In your paper you are saying decisions should be taken in consensus and on a collegial basis, but that is very impractical because you cannot take a decision on intervention if everybody agrees that the EEC style but you cannot pursue monetary policy with consensus amongst twelve members. You raise all these kinds of questions if you set up a new institution, but if we would discuss intervention vis-à-vis third currencies and even if we reach no agreement we could at least say that the majority is of the opinion ... and we give this view to the central banks or the governments who are in charge of intervention. It is different in different countries, in some countries it is the government which decides on intervention - in most countries I think - and in other countries like in Germany it is the central bank. There is another area where we, as an upgraded Committee of central bank Governors, could give advice in a very delicate area, but I think we should be courageous, and that is exchange rates. I wonder why that hasn't been mentioned in the whole context? If we really want to achieve more stability in the EMS - well maybe it was mentioned, but not in your paper for instance - we cannot rely on intervention alone, of course, we need better convergence of fiscal economic policy but if that does not happen we need from time to time realignments, if we don't need any realignment then we have reached the state of a monetary union. That is fine but not very likely to happen in the next couple of years. I can easily conceive situations in which we as central bank Governors come to the conclusion that further or even more intervention in the exchange markets would get in conflict with our monetary targets with the main objective of monetary policy, i.e. to maintain price stability. Mariano, I don't think the central banks are created to operate in the exchange markets, that is not the main task of a central bank, at least not in my country. (Rubio: they were in the 19th Century.) Maybe, but in the Bundesbank law which was only approved in 1957 and is a little more modern, it is said expressively that it is the main task to maintain the stability of the currency. If that would get in conflict - interventions in the exchange markets - we could maybe ask the governments to change the exchange rates. I have no illusions, Jacques Delors and myself tried to persuade the Ministers to give this authority to this group but as you know we didn't succeed. Frankly speaking I never expected to succeed, it was more a kind of provocation, but necessary maybe to show how difficult it is to transfer powers from one institution to another. We could suggest that at least we examine whether the exchange rate pattern is reasonable, appropriate, I think there is no better institution than the Council of Central Bank Governors to come to an objective judgement and if we would come to such a conclusion that would be very rare of course and wouldn't happen very often, but let us assume we would say with these surplus in Germany the best thing to do is to have a little realignment. With this kind of approach we would avoid a lot of problems which are in my view not solvable and which are raised in your proposal, Jacques. For instance, the problem of voting rights. Is it really a good proposal from our group to say that only central banks who participate in the ERM are allowed to participate in this fund, or in other words, you can only be a member of the fund and participate in this decision-making process, European co-ordination process, if you participate in the exchange rate mechanism. It would be a very strong political decision if one would say that, if the Council would say that, and if we would propose it. I would hesitate to make such a political proposal. In my suggestion this problem would not appear because we could give a recommendation on exchange rates including our British, Spanish, Greek and Portuguese colleagues, we could give a recommendation even without reaching a full agreement. That I think has some advantages. I think there are a lot of other advantages, the only doubt which I have is - and I have to check that with my lawyers - whether such a decision of the Council saying that we give the authority, adding to Article 2 of the Council Decision of May 1964 two or three paragraphs saying that we, the Council, authorise the Council of Governors, which we will call the European Central Bank Council in future, to set up a Secretariat maybe and to give recommendations on all these subjects to those national authorities which are responsible. Whether that is possible, in the case of Germany I don't know, in other countries and I would be grateful if you would maybe check that also, without rather far-reaching changes in legislation. I think it is possible, there will be an uproar, if I think what happened when this German/French Council was established, but in my view and my judgement something like that would still be within the given leader framework conceivable. That is what I wanted to add to the discussion at this point. Maybe if you want me to write that down in more detail, particularly with the legal aspect, I am fully prepared to do that and to provide you with not a long paper, not 50 pages this time, but a little paper on that subject.","Mr. Chairman, I would like to come back to the question which was raised by Governor Hoffmeyer at the beginning, because I think that is the most important question, at least from a legal and institutional point of view, which we have to have in mind - the political reality in Europe.

J. de Larosière,Jacques de Larosière,1535 - 1621,1535,1621,86,1,1,,EN,"I am sorry to intervene perhaps a little more than I usually try to do in these meetings, but as it is my paper which has been the focus of this discussion I feel entitled to say a few words if only to tell you what I have in mind. I understand what you say when you say that my concept, to use a short expression, is not compatible with gradualism, that is the argument made by Mr. Hoffmeyer which you followed up. I agree with the following qualifications and understandings. It is perfectly correct to say that the institutional changes that are implied by my proposal are destined, are intended, to be completed, supplemented, by further institutional changes in the direction of full monetary integration. In this respect I fully agree with you both when you said that you are proposing something that is a part of a whole dynamics. But, and here I would make my qualification, I would very strongly say that the different steps towards this full monetary integration have to be staged, staggered, and that each of the steps will have to be the object of probably unanimous agreement by all the members concerned by, or participant in, the general endeavour. You could imagine that if the consensus was not there, to move towards the final stage you would indeed have only an initial or some preliminary steps without the remainder following. I would also agree that that would be an incomplete outcome of what I had in mind.

Secondly, I understand very well what Karl-Otto was saying and I appreciate what he has been putting on the table because it is an effort to put a little more precision in what  you can do with this Committee of Governors, how you can beef it up, put some muscles and teeth in it and make it a little more credible and effective? I appreciate that because it goes in the right direction. With due respect, I don't think it is exactly what we have been asked to do, because one of the great merits, as you said, of your proposal is derived from something that I am not extremely impressed by and that is that it doesn't involve legislative changes, it does not complicate the political settings nationally, it is compatible but you are not even sure that it is compatible, you are going to have to study that, it is more or less compatible with the present setting. On this I have an intellectual reservation. We have been asked by the Heads of State, whether we like it or not, and I may well understand that some of us have other profound problems with the whole exercise, but we have been asked to make some proposals or write a report on the subject: how do you reach monetary integration and economic integration? Although it is a very realistic thing to say let us try and see how we could go in that direction without changing anything of the legal setting, I am very much in favour of what Mr. Ciampi said, we have an historical opportunity to answer that question and if we start by saying we are going to answer it in a way that doesn't disturb anything in the present setting, I think we haven't really done what we were asked to do. I think we can develop these ideas and show them that would look like that, but I don't think you could really argue that this is a major determining criterion in our work. (Pöhl: Jacques you forgot the first part of my proposal which was ...) Yes, but I have a little bit of suspicion here that if you put my proposals in the same bag - and you very artfully do that with some of your friends - this is the utopian thing, OK you have got the very far-away utopia of Mr. Thygesen's report and even the more further one that you have asked him to work on and then you put de Larosière in that because that is one parcel, and then you have the realistic guys who are going to suggest that we beef up the monthly meeting in Basle. Now, you haven't said that and I would perfectly admit that I am being a little bit provocative in putting it that way, but you see we have to also look into the institutional aspects, as Carlo Ciampi said, if we have good ideas on the contents, on the substance, then let us look at the legal aspects. We are not parliaments today and we are allowed to look into these things. I am going to tell you something which is a little bit the reverse of what you have in your own view: it is clear that what I am suggesting in my paper implies, I didn't put it that way but it does imply, a very profound modification of the relationship between the governing body of the Banque de France and the Ministry of Finance. In my view it is absolutely clear, I didn't stress it but it is there. I would like that to happen and I know there will be upheaval in the Treasury, but it is also something we have to see as the positive side. Don't you think Europe would be stronger with central banks that would be more independent, autonomous, in a structure like the one I described than not to change anything in the legal aspects and to sort of muddle through? (Pöhl: that is a little bit unfair, because these proposals would have some weight ...)

Now, I am going to be completely unfair on my last point and then I will shut up. When you say that it is a bit provocative not to make two categories of countries, those who are in the ERM and those who are not, I would say that I explained that it was a logical out-grow of what I had in mind. I wouldn't see very well how a country that is not in the narrow band could really mix into those types of decisions on inter-European currency interventions. In a way, you said that it is a very political proposal to leave them out, I would say that it is a very political decision for them to have been left out of the ERM and of course they are welcome in.","I am sorry to intervene perhaps a little more than I usually try to do in these meetings, but as it is my paper which has been the focus of this discussion I feel entitled to say a few words if only to tell you what I have in mind.

In a way, you said that it is a very political proposal to leave them out, I would say that it is a very political decision for them to have been left out of the ERM and of course they are welcome in."

3,11/8/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",144,M. P. Jaans,Pierre Jaans,1653 - 1705,1653,1705,52,1,1,,EN,"The European Council has asked us to say how to come to monetary union. We have discussed what monetary union is, it basically means fixed exchange rates and freedom of capital movements, and I think this Committee has to indicate quite clearly to the European Council that the way to get there implies the creation of a mechanism of decision - of common decisions and of binding decisions - and these decisions have to be taken under a specific mission, which also has to be defined clearly and legally, i.e. the maintenance of internal price stability and eventually in the countries the institutional frameworks and relationships between the Treasuries and the central banks would have to be changed, but the important thing is to state quite clearly that we cannot, so to say, steal ourselves around on that road, around a common and binding mechanism of decision-making. One will probably have to give a description of how that mechanism has to look and even if it is a disgrace ... (Pöhl(?): is that in the first step?) Well, I think in our report and the first step on that road really is to have a political consensus that that is the road. One may now postpone the moment when the decisions made in ? become binding in a couple of years or some time horizon, but I think it would not be responsible on the part of this Committee to say that there is a kind of half-hearted, partial, way of coming to something where the public might believe it could be a monetary union. I think one has to be quite clear about the political price in terms of amending sovereignty which is pay there. (?)

With regard to the implementation of such decisions, I think we can have, of course, all kinds of recipes and instructions like the ones presented by Prof. Thygesen or Governor de Larosière, but the aim being coming to fixed exchange rates, these common decisions can very well be implemented through the existing central banks and the common decisions can be limited to what is necessary to come to fixed exchange rates or to the stability of exchange rates. That means basically interventions and it means interest rates and interest rate differentials, eventually also realignments. To come on that road - and one of the difficulties in our discussion I think is how to slice it into stages, since in the mandate the word stages or steps are used. Why not slice that in a gradual narrowing of the bands? If one aims at stability of exchange rates, at some stage one will have to abandon the 2,5 thing we have now and one will have to decide whether we go to zero right now or whether we go to one or whatever - but that may well be the road. The final stage, which should be described or outlined at least - a final architecture so to say of a European Central Bank - that need not be indicated that it should be there by 2000 or 2010, but if through the decision mechanism and its implementation through the existing central bank, one comes to a stage where the parities are durably fixed, then it can be simply an enabling decision for central banks to merge in a joint venture or whatever. That would be just one way and I think at this stage that is not so important.

With regard to this mechanism of common decisions, of course, we could take as a point of departure the Committee of Governors, but it would be a totally different Committee of Governors with regard to its competences. Just an upgrading, so to say, of the present Committee of Governors without the necessity for legal changes, possibly, I would even hesitate to offer that kind of thing in the report because that is the kind of slippery road to steal out, so to say, politically. I think that would immediately be seized as a way out and insofar I am not so convinced about the second part of your exposé, President Pöhl (... it's a good session!) since the real road, the sincere road, probably has a number of political difficulties but why shouldn't politicians acknowledge that there are difficulties there.

The approach by Governor de Larosière, of course, has the merits of having a kind of learning institution, but again since it is only a partial thing, the risk is that it could be seized, all the more so as it is visible - that seems to be a very important concern. It would be visible but it could stay very partial and become less and less visible, so to me that way is a little too homeopathic perhaps. That was all I wanted to say at this stage. (M. Lamfalussy: What is your ? - only one jump?) No, actually the road to monetary union, that is to fixed exchange rates, could well pass through the existing central banks with common decision-making at some level and through a gradual narrowing of margins, and that can be left to the central banks.","The European Council has asked us to say how to come to monetary union.

4,12/13/1988,OK,,"T, P, B",230,Prof. N. Thygesen,Niels Thygesen,1117 - 1138,1117,1138,21,1,1,,EN,"Mr. President, contrary to two people who have already spoken, I am happy with the balance of the report. Indeed, my main concern with it is that it makes the demands on other policies too stringent, rather more stringent than I think they are. I think there are three reasons why there has to be a certain imbalance between the monetary and economic parts of our report. Firstly, a principle of subsidiarity itself. In the monetary area, given some of the decisions that have already been taken, a degree of financial integration that we can foresee, a high degree of centralisation of decision-making is required to make for efficient policies. There are some arguments in favour of that centralisation, which do not apply to a similar degree to the fiscal area where both welfare considerations and allocative concerns dictate a much higher degree of national sovereign decision-making. So there is certainly a clear difference in degree between the different kinds of policies. The second reason is a simple one that this is a Committee, Governor Doyle referred to that, largely of central bankers and it would be strange if it did not emphasise primarily the area in which it has expertise. The third reason is, and that was touched upon by our President, that economic union is not in itself a very well defined concept, unless you begin to discuss it in the context of monetary union, then some things begin to emerge - the accompanying policies, requirements on other policies. For those three reasons I think there has to be a certain imbalance in the report and that discussion of the monetary union has to come before the economic union. I join Prof. Lamfalussy on that point.","Mr. President, contrary to two people who have already spoken, I am happy with the balance of the report. Indeed, my main concern with it is that it makes the demands on other policies too stringent, rather more stringent than I think they are. I think there are three reasons why there has to be a certain imbalance between the monetary and economic parts of our report. Firstly, a principle of subsidiarity itself. In the monetary area, given some of the decisions that have already been taken, a degree of financial integration that we can foresee, a high degree of centralisation of decision-making is required to make for efficient policies. There are some arguments in favour of that centralisation, which do not apply to a similar degree to the fiscal area where both welfare considerations and allocative concerns dictate a much higher degree of national sovereign decision-making. So there is certainly a clear difference in degree between the different kinds of policies. The second reason is a simple one that this is a Committee, Governor Doyle referred to that, largely of central bankers and it would be strange if it did not emphasise primarily the area in which it has expertise. The third reason is, and that was touched upon by our President, that economic union is not in itself a very well defined concept, unless you begin to discuss it in the context of monetary union, then some things begin to emerge - the accompanying policies, requirements on other policies. For those three reasons I think there has to be a certain imbalance in the report and that discussion of the monetary union has to come before the economic union.

It is not only a matter of financial transfers, but it is also a matter of how the resources are going to be used. Finally, the authors of the report thought, without perhaps being clear enough, that a European fiscal framework was necessary. Personally I translate this as follows: the major structures of compulsory withholding taxes of various kinds will have to be very similar in our various countries. If you look at tax levied on private income, corporate tax on wages and salaries, it will be very difficult to have an economic union if the differences are too great between our various countries, as at present.

The most practical way of tackling this is to say, what are the instruments which should be used at the Community level and what are the instruments that can be used by the individual countries themselves? Countries with a discipline of more fixed exchange rates, I think that what can be done by the individual countries will be to handle very classical, conventional instruments of supply policy, their markets will have to become more flexible, they ought to be able to organise their expenses and their tax systems, taking into account the movement of labour and other resources in order to give incentives for saving, etc. Do you add the possibility that each country may still have a free hand in developing its territory, its land? That is very important, well yes it is not so important for us to recall the classical factors of development in each country, but there continue to be certain things that will fall to the countries and what we have to do in the report is to indicate what can be done at the Community level, since one will have given up the exchange rates. What will one be able to do at the Community level, in order to eliminate or reduce the differences between member countries? Monetary policy is eliminated, what is left is fiscal policy or the constraints will come from monetary aspects. I think that a central bank system will find it very difficult to give up the capability of saying the maximum deficit a country can accept is so much and for financing the deficit we will take this or that form. One will have to fix some limits to the deficit and to its funding, this being said there may be efforts at harmonisation. There the British position, which says let us do this not by agreeing on an initial compromise but let us let things move and let us see how these things will develop. Except for the harmonisation of tax levied on capital profits, the exchange rate discipline will apply considerable constraint on certain fiscal elements. A deficit must be fixed, its funding and what is left to the Community Regional policy and the implementation of the 1992 package to the elimination of the movement of persons and capital, one accepts that this movement will take place and one wishes to facilitate it and what is left after that? Only regional policy. The whole of the economic policy that can be talked about at the end will be the Community's regional policy - we haven't discussed this because we need reports, documentation.

Firstly, I fully agree with what has been said. I think any European central bank system has to be included in a framework, as has been said here in this skeleton, and I have no objections to using that as an introduction, that one has to see the European monetary institution as part of the European decision-making process, there is no doubt about that. As far as the Bundesbank law is concerned, Robin, it says that the Bundesbank has to support the economic policy of the Government as long as this does not conflict with its prior responsibility to safeguard the currency. The formulation is very vague. What I think we should avoid is to begin a discussion of all the details of a European central bank system. I think that has to be left to official intergovernmental negotiations, because that has to be a legal, binding Treaty and we can make recommendations, suggestions, and I am fully prepared if you want to go into more detail, point by point, I am open to that. But at this stage, and taking into account the political situation and several statements made by Prime Ministers, etc., I think it would be more realistic to say, if you want to have an economic and monetary union you have to be aware that that needs a certain legal and institutional framework. For economic union you have made this proposal for an economic policy centre, and I have not referred to that; as far as monetary union is concerned, you need the framework for a European central bank system. We cannot draft all the details of such a statute, but if you want to ask a group of experts to negotiate a statute for a European central bank system, and this is our recommendation to you, it should be done on the following lines. It should include the following features. That is my suggestion, if you think it is more advisable for all the reasons you mentioned to go more into detail, I am fully prepared to discuss that, but then we have to discuss it point by point and we will easily, very soon, reach a point where we recognise that we have very different conceptions on how such an institution should be organised, to whom it should report. For instance, if you say it should report to the Council of Ministers, I would never propose that, I would never subscribe to such a recommendation because it is not consistent with our basic philosophy in this area. I would have less problems if you could agree to say this institution should report to a committee of the European Parliament, for instance, something like the Federal Reserve System where the Chairman of the Fed has to report to Congress. In Germany I don't have to report either to the Government or to the Parliament, in other countries it is different. So that is a very very difficult question. Another question is, for instance, where should the seat of that institution be - should it be in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or where? We don't have to answer that question, we can't answer it, we don't have to answer it fortunately. It is a political decision. If we tell the Heads of State and governments, look, if you want the monetary union you will reach a point, and maybe you will reach it earlier than most people expected, where the exchange rates are rather inflexible maybe even locked, even irrevocably locked, and when you have that you need a central bank system and if you want a central bank system you have to answer this kind of question.

I would have less problems if you could agree to say this institution should report to a committee of the European Parliament, for instance, something like the Federal Reserve System where the Chairman of the Fed has to report to Congress. In Germany I don't have to report either to the Government or to the Parliament, in other countries it is different. So that is a very very difficult question. Another question is, for instance, where should the seat of that institution be - should it be in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or where? We don't have to answer that question, we can't answer it, we don't have to answer it fortunately. It is a political decision. If we tell the Heads of State and governments, look, if you want the monetary union you will reach a point, and maybe you will reach it earlier than most people expected, where the exchange rates are rather inflexible maybe even locked, even irrevocably locked, and when you have that you need a central bank system and if you want a central bank system you have to answer this kind of question. I don't think we have to say more."

The limits to be imposed on fiscal deficits will derive from monetary policy considerations and it may very well be that recommendations emerge from the central bank system. To preserve exchange rates, etc., to control the growth of the money supply, central banks will in practice define that the limits should not be exceeded in terms of budget deficits. So I don't think that you need a body to meet once a year to talk about deficits and limits. This will be a by-product of the Community monetary policy, no, it is far more complicated than that. If one talks only about financial transfers, a country which is below the average in terms of GDP per capita, this country will receive transfers not only by virtue of the regional policy but other policies and also the common agricultural policy and the percentage may be 3, 4 or even 5% of GDP. Therefore there is a constitutional problem, because the European Parliament is party to the approval or not of the Community budget and even if it all boils down to the very simple things that you have mentioned, nevertheless, the convergence procedure must be strengthened because it is not working well. The convergence procedure is as though you celebrated High Mass while having lost your faith already. But there is the problem of fiscal deficit, compatible with monetary policy.

the partial pooling of reserves and interventions, but one would have to see whether this is possible without amending the Treaty. Yes, I am quite certain but I am not certain that this is possible without amending national legislation. Since you have put the question to me I am going to tell you how it would work. An intervention fund would be set up whose purpose would be to intervene in third currencies. This would involve the pooling of 5 or 10% of the member countries reserves, the Fund would administer these pooled reserves and would intervene in the currency market under the conditions that govern concentrations. Concertation in other words, we are not trying upset the monetary policy of member countries in any way, we might even say that should there be conflict at the beginning between various central banks about an intervention, the fund would not intervene, it would move only once consensus had been reached. There would be a monetary analysis department in this Fund and this department should analyse money internally and externally and this would, one hopes, make it easier to arrive at a Community stance in respect of a rate of growth, growth of the money supply for the Community as whole. I think one could go further, in respect of preparing economic co-ordination, if one had this analysis department and if one limits oneself to exchanging information between central banks, each central bank, of course, being governed by its own objectives in regard of monetary policy. Then I describe what the structure of this think-tank on monetary analysis might be. There might be an executive committee on which one would have the Governors of central banks and then a management committee, which would be appointed by the Governors, selected by the Governors, which would be very small and which would look after the management of the two departments in this fund. It is very modest, as you can see. I thought that this would be a first step and would be part and parcel of the Treaty even if it does not acquire the dignity of entailing an amendment to the Treaty. I thought that it wouldn't be a bad thing to make a start in this way, make a start immediately negotiating the Treaty, drafting the Treaty, ratifying it as quickly as possible and the first step that would be taken would be described in some detail in the Treaty.

Section III of the Report is one of the items and then a discussion, which I suggest should be a separate discussion, on the ECU - separate because the matter is so complex. If we complete our discussion on Section III, which is fairly complex, and if we also manage to conclude our discussion on the ECU, then at the February meeting we would have before us a new draft of Section II on the final stage of the economic and monetary union, which will have taken into account everything that was said during the very fruitful December meeting. This would enable us to review Section II and would also enable us to come up with an answer to the following question. As the Report stands, is not too much of the burden of regulating financial transactions put on the monetary authorities and if we go too far in the direction of a transfer of powers then I am afraid we are going to end up with a solution which is totally unrealistic and certainly unacceptable - but we will rediscuss this. Then we will have to have a conversation on regional policy. The other day Mr. Boyer said, in order to clarify the situation, quite apart from the general framework which enables one to exercise some control on fiscal and economic policy, regional policy will make us think about the conditions which have to be satisfied for economic cohesion within the framework of an economic and monetary union which goes beyond what the Single European Act will bring about. Implementing the Single Act, of course, implies better co-operation in the macro-economic field and the monetary field, but economic and monetary union is a step beyond that and I think that in our first Part we make this quite clear. People are not quite aware of this, quite a lot of politicians enjoy muddling the whole thing. Scientifically one cannot say that the economic and monetary union is necessary for the successful implementation of the Single European Act, what we can say on the other hand is that in order to achieve all the objectives of the Single Act, and if we had never talked about economic and monetary union, we would nevertheless have found that we have to strengthen our co-operation in the monetary area and in the field of macro-economic policy - this we have to be quite clear about. This would then mean that in good time before the March meeting you would have a full draft of the Report which we might examine and then we would do the same
thing on a second draft in April. This would mean that the Committee would not only have discussed each topic, but would also have an overall view of the whole thing, not at the very last meeting but before that. Would this schedule be acceptable to you? We might of course refine it, taking into account your comments.

If this proves satisfactory we can then move on to Section III. At the last meeting the chapter-by-chapter discussion of Section II proved quite useful.

5,1/10/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",426,Herrn K.-O. Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,397 - 630,397,630,233,,,,EN,"I think, Mr. Chairman, that is a good proposal if I may say so, because that is really the core of the matter. There is no reason for confrontation because we are not here in a negotiating process, we just study these matters and discuss them and everybody is free to express his own views, there is no reason for any kind of confrontation. Having said that, I think it would be very regrettable if we would come up with a Report which gives the impression that the Heads of State and governments have the choice between two different scenarios, as we call them. Two scenarios which give the impression of being equal, have the same weight and that there is a choice. That is not the case I think, because I think several of us - at least myself - cannot accept Scenario B and I want to make that very clear. I wonder whether we shouldn't try to aim, at least, for only one scenario, one set of concrete proposals and if we can't reach agreement on certain proposals, particularly the proposal of the Reserve Fund and that is the main point, maybe we can persuade those who have proposed that to give up the idea, but that remains to be seen.

I have to apologise that I am going to speak a little longer because I have several points to make and I want to make them in context, and I think it is very important and leads us really to the core of the matter. On pages 5 and 6 it is said that ""both scenarios see scope for immediate and meaningful measures in both the economic and monetary areas"", but then the Report lists a number of what the Report calls ""justifications for a more substantial first step"", as outlined in Scenario B. That gives the impression - and I think the wrong impression - that Scenario A is the less substantial of the two scenarios. I do not agree with that interpretation and I would like to see that the Report correctly reflects the intentions and substance of Scenario A, which is the one I suggested here at one of our previous meetings. To this end I have prepared a new text for pages 5 and 6 beginning with the 2nd paragraph on p. 5 which lists the arguments in support of both scenarios in I think a more balanced way and not only those in support of one scenario. For that purpose I have prepared a text which I would like the Secretariat to distribute to you. I would like to read the text which should replace paragraph 2 on p. 5, starting with ""Both scenarios ..."". (Reads text).

That is so to say the balanced description of the philosophy behind Scenario A and then if we cannot avoid it - I hope we can find a compromise - we could continue saying ""Scenario B considers the creation ..."" as it has been said in the Report. This is on the addition of the Report. What I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, is that we give this text to the Secretariat - we don't have to discuss it in detail here, I don't insist on that - and that we leave it to the Secretariat to include at least the spirit of this addition in the next version of our Report.

I want to say a few words on the substance and the legal problems which I see with respect to the so-called Scenario B. Firstly, I think one can make a lot of substantial points about the question of whether one really needs a Fund with the main purpose, the emphasis on intervention in the exchange markets. I think the emphasis is wrongly placed because it gives the impression to the public and to the governments that we are really able to manage the EMS by intensifying intervention and that the main, or one of the major problems of a European Monetary System would be to co-ordinate interventions against third currencies. This is in my view not the case. What we really need is better co-ordination and more agreement on the objectives of monetary policy. That is also included, but in second place and it doesn't have the same rating in the proposal as the question of intervention. That is becoming very clear because it is a Reserve Fund, that is the first step.

The other thing is that I really don't think that we need such an institution in order to improve the functioning of the EMS. We have done what we could to improve the functioning of the EMS in the Basle/Nyborg agreement, we have gone very far to increase the short-term credit facilities, etc. and there is, in my view at least, no reason to set up a new institution just to improve the functioning of the EMS. What is really necessary for the better functioning of the EMS, or for the strengthening of the EMS, in my view is of course that all member countries are able and, willing to participate in the EMS. I think we should as a group - I hope we can include all our members - really strongly emphasise the message that full membership and full participation in fulfilling the rules of the EMS and pursuing the policies which are necessary to fulfil the rules and participate in the EMS is the major step forward in the direction of a monetary union. It is not very spectacular and not very new but that is what we really need and not a new institution. That is on the substance of the thing. I have one point on the substance, one could say a lot of other things.

Another point which I think is very important are the legal considerations. Article 102A, as introduced in the EEC Treaty by the Single European Act, has clarified that ""insofar as further development of economic and monetary policy necessitates institutional changes"" - and this is
certainly an institutional change setting up a Fund like this and transferring part of the national reserves to a supra-international institution - ""the provisions of Article 236 shall be applicable"". That is clearly stated in this Single European Act, there is no doubt about that. The Article comes under the heading ""Co-operation in economic and monetary policy (economic and monetary union)"" - that is by the way the only place where economic and monetary union is mentioned in a European legal paper. So it is not limited to the institutional changes proposed in the context of progress towards monetary union, but to any institutional changes in the area of monetary and economic policy. I think that is very clear and that was one of the major points of controversy when this was discussed in Luxembourg. The establishment of a Reserve Fund would no doubt be an institutional change and would thus fall under the stipulated procedure of Article 236 and it could be done, in my view, only in the context of this Treaty which we are discussing. If we find it reasonable and appropriate then I don't think it would be necessary, but if we find it necessary it has to be included in the negotiating process for a Treaty. It could be argued, and that would be an alternative I agree, as mentioned in Scenario B, but we shouldn't underestimate the difficulties of that alternative which would be that we would change national laws in each of the European countries. In our case, for instance, it would mean that if we would set up such a Fund with all the powers transferred to that Fund that we would have to change the Bundesbankgesetz, but that is maybe even more complicated than a procedure under Article 236. What I think is absolutely impossible and not acceptable legally would be a procedure which led to the creation of the EMS, just a Council decision and leave it to the Council of Governors or the ECOFIN to fill the details, that I think is very contrary to all principles which we have defended over the last 10 years since we discussed the establishment of the EMS. For that legal reason alone, if not for other reasons, I think this Scenario B is practically not conceivable. What can we do? What I would be prepared to discuss is that we include part of the proposals in Scenario B into Scenario A, which would then be the only proposal. For instance, it has been said in Scenario A that there should be a Committee for banking supervision, this has to be clarified whether that is acceptable or not, but I would be prepared and ready to accept also that we would set up two other committees - the two suggested in Governor de Larosière's proposal - namely one for the co-ordination of exchange rate policies and another for the co-ordination of monetary
policy. These are the two proposals in his paper. That I think can be done as long as these committees have no decision-taking power, can give only recommendations to the governors and then the governors could, under the proposals in Scenario A, give recommendations to governments, central banks, etc. This is still conceivable in my view with existing laws, without changing the Treaty or having a new Treaty. It goes very far and maybe it will be questioned whether it is consistent, but I would be prepared to go that far. I think those would be two substantial elements from Scenario B which we could include in Scenario A. What I cannot and would not accept is the proposal of setting up a Reserve Fund with all this emphasis on intervention which I think gives a completely wrong impression and is legally not acceptable.

My last point is the following. If the Committee is not prepared to follow my suggestion and if some colleagues insist on having the two scenarios, I would very much urge you to indicate very clearly in the Report - at first here in the group, but later maybe also in the Report - who is supporting Scenario A and who is supporting Scenario B, because we should not give the impression that these are two things the Heads of State and governments could choose between.
","I think, Mr. Chairman, that is a good proposal if I may say so, because that is really the core of the matter. There is no reason for confrontation because we are not here in a negotiating process, we just study these matters and discuss them and everybody is free to express his own views, there is no reason for any kind of confrontation. Having said that, I think it would be very regrettable if we would come up with a Report which gives the impression that the Heads of State and governments have the choice between two different scenarios, as we call them. Two scenarios which give the impression of being equal, have the same weight and that there is a choice. That is not the case I think, because I think several of us - at least myself - cannot accept Scenario B and I want to make that very clear. I wonder whether we shouldn't try to aim, at least, for only one scenario, one set of concrete proposals and if we can't reach agreement on certain proposals, particularly the proposal of the Reserve Fund and that is the main point, maybe we can persuade those who have proposed that to give up the idea, but that remains to be seen.

I have to apologise that I am going to speak a little longer because I have several points to make and I want to make them in context, and I think it is very important and leads us really to the core of the matter. On pages 5 and 6 it is said that ""both scenarios see scope for immediate and meaningful measures in both the economic and monetary areas"", but then the Report lists a number of what the Report calls ""justifications for a more substantial first step"", as outlined in Scenario B. That gives the impression - and I think the wrong impression - that Scenario A is the less substantial of the two scenarios. I do not agree with that interpretation and I would like to see that the Report correctly reflects the intentions and substance of Scenario A, which is the one I suggested here at one of our previous meetings. To this end I have prepared a new text for pages 5 and 6 beginning with the 2nd paragraph on p. 5 which lists the arguments in support of both scenarios in I think a more balanced way and not only those in support of one scenario. For that purpose I have prepared a text which I would like the Secretariat to distribute to you. I would like to read the text which should replace paragraph 2 on p. 5, starting with ""Both scenarios ..."". (Reads text).

That is so to say the balanced description of the philosophy behind Scenario A and then if we cannot avoid it - I hope we can find a compromise - we could continue saying ""Scenario B considers the creation ..."" as it has been said in the Report. This is on the addition of the Report. What I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, is that we give this text to the Secretariat - we don't have to discuss it in detail here, I don't insist on that - and that we leave it to the Secretariat to include at least the spirit of this addition in the next version of our Report.

I want to say a few words on the substance and the legal problems which I see with respect to the so-called Scenario B. Firstly, I think one can make a lot of substantial points about the question of whether one really needs a Fund with the main purpose, the emphasis on intervention in the exchange markets. I think the emphasis is wrongly placed because it gives the impression to the public and to the governments that we are really able to manage the EMS by intensifying intervention and that the main, or one of the major problems of a European Monetary System would be to co-ordinate interventions against third currencies. This is in my view not the case. What we really need is better co-ordination and more agreement on the objectives of monetary policy. That is also included, but in second place and it doesn't have the same rating in the proposal as the question of intervention. That is becoming very clear because it is a Reserve Fund, that is the first step.

The other thing is that I really don't think that we need such an institution in order to improve the functioning of the EMS. We have done what we could to improve the functioning of the EMS in the Basle/Nyborg agreement, we have gone very far to increase the short-term credit facilities, etc. and there is, in my view at least, no reason to set up a new institution just to improve the functioning of the EMS. What is really necessary for the better functioning of the EMS, or for the strengthening of the EMS, in my view is of course that all member countries are able and, willing to participate in the EMS. I think we should as a group - I hope we can include all our members - really strongly emphasise the message that full membership and full participation in fulfilling the rules of the EMS and pursuing the policies which are necessary to fulfil the rules and participate in the EMS is the major step forward in the direction of a monetary union. It is not very spectacular and not very new but that is what we really need and not a new institution. That is on the substance of the thing. I have one point on the substance, one could say a lot of other things.

Another point which I think is very important are the legal considerations. Article 102A, as introduced in the EEC Treaty by the Single European Act, has clarified that ""insofar as further development of economic and monetary policy necessitates institutional changes"" - and this is
certainly an institutional change setting up a Fund like this and transferring part of the national reserves to a supra-international institution - ""the provisions of Article 236 shall be applicable"". That is clearly stated in this Single European Act, there is no doubt about that. The Article comes under the heading ""Co-operation in economic and monetary policy (economic and monetary union)"" - that is by the way the only place where economic and monetary union is mentioned in a European legal paper. So it is not limited to the institutional changes proposed in the context of progress towards monetary union, but to any institutional changes in the area of monetary and economic policy. I think that is very clear and that was one of the major points of controversy when this was discussed in Luxembourg. The establishment of a Reserve Fund would no doubt be an institutional change and would thus fall under the stipulated procedure of Article 236 and it could be done, in my view, only in the context of this Treaty which we are discussing. If we find it reasonable and appropriate then I don't think it would be necessary, but if we find it necessary it has to be included in the negotiating process for a Treaty. It could be argued, and that would be an alternative I agree, as mentioned in Scenario B, but we shouldn't underestimate the difficulties of that alternative which would be that we would change national laws in each of the European countries. In our case, for instance, it would mean that if we would set up such a Fund with all the powers transferred to that Fund that we would have to change the Bundesbankgesetz, but that is maybe even more complicated than a procedure under Article 236. What I think is absolutely impossible and not acceptable legally would be a procedure which led to the creation of the EMS, just a Council decision and leave it to the Council of Governors or the ECOFIN to fill the details, that I think is very contrary to all principles which we have defended over the last 10 years since we discussed the establishment of the EMS. For that legal reason alone, if not for other reasons, I think this Scenario B is practically not conceivable. What can we do? What I would be prepared to discuss is that we include part of the proposals in Scenario B into Scenario A, which would then be the only proposal. For instance, it has been said in Scenario A that there should be a Committee for banking supervision, this has to be clarified whether that is acceptable or not, but I would be prepared and ready to accept also that we would set up two other committees - the two suggested in Governor de Larosière's proposal - namely one for the co-ordination of exchange rate policies and another for the co-ordination of monetary
policy. These are the two proposals in his paper. That I think can be done as long as these committees have no decision-taking power, can give only recommendations to the governors and then the governors could, under the proposals in Scenario A, give recommendations to governments, central banks, etc. This is still conceivable in my view with existing laws, without changing the Treaty or having a new Treaty. It goes very far and maybe it will be questioned whether it is consistent, but I would be prepared to go that far. I think those would be two substantial elements from Scenario B which we could include in Scenario A. What I cannot and would not accept is the proposal of setting up a Reserve Fund with all this emphasis on intervention which I think gives a completely wrong impression and is legally not acceptable.

My last point is the following. If the Committee is not prepared to follow my suggestion and if some colleagues insist on having the two scenarios, I would very much urge you to indicate very clearly in the Report - at first here in the group, but later maybe also in the Report - who is supporting Scenario A and who is supporting Scenario B, because we should not give the impression that these are two things the Heads of State and governments could choose between.

J. de Larosière said, are we feeling that it is really inconceivable that we should accept an institutional change? I answer that by saying, certainly not. We are going to have an institutional change at some stage in our proceedings if we are to achieve economic and monetary union and I support that. What I feel so anxious about is acquiring institutional change in Stage 1.

secure progress? I am extremely worried that we will not secure Treaty change for Stage 1. In the case of my country the formation of the ERF will require domestic legislation.

It is also true, however, that to go further during the first stage would require substantial legal changes to be introduced and legal changes require a lot of time, so the first steps can certainly not amount to very much if one cannot envisage such fundamental changes. This being said I think that there is consensus on this, namely that the nucleus of the central bank system and the strengthening of the Committee of Governors are more important than setting up a ERF. If one creates too many bodies then perhaps there won't be enough left to the Committee of Governors, which ultimately has to be the motor of the whole exercise.

We have before us two scenarios and I agree that if we submit two scenarios in our Report with different degrees of consensus, this as I see it would water down the importance of our Report and would also reduce the impact it may have on our readers.

As for the problems of substance I should like to repeat something which I have said time and again and which was a concern of mine. 1990, firstly, and then 1992. If we are going to confront these dates under present conditions then we shall run very serious dangers, dangers for the existing system. I have always made this point very clearly at Committee of Governors' meetings. Hence, it appears to me extremely important to ensure that by 1990 already we have made an important step forward towards a monetary policy which will be agreed and managed jointly by central banks on an ex ante basis, this in order to avoid our running the risk of having to cope with a crisis descending on a system which has been working very well for 10 years now. This is my basic concern. Then it seems to me that a number of things which are included in Scenario A can already be implemented within the existing bodies, for instance, the Committee of Governors. There is no reason why we should not give ourselves a Secretariat which would look after monetary policy. There is no reason at
all why we should not make other decisions of an effective and practical nature and which would help us, for instance, to constantly evaluate our policies and we might come up with recommendations about these policies which we might even make public. In Scenario B what I found to be important was the qualitative leap over and beyond the ways in which all of this
would be put into practice. I am not saying that I would like to attach so much importance to a policy of intervention, and after all Governor de Larosière has somewhat watered down his position on this, I would emphasise other things: monetary policy, intervention in a wider sense of the word and which might occur after consultation. If one is confronted by a crisis due to capital movements, a joint examination by central bank Governors of the situation which would result in their making a clear statement as to the nature of the crisis and after that there would be joint action to face up to this crisis. This is of fundamental importance as I see it. Therefore in Scenario B what I see is the emphasis put on this quantitative leap. There is no doubt at all that Scenario B would involve institutional changes and hence would cause problems, in particular problems in respect of the time frame.

the institutional field preparation and modification of the Treaty"". Now phase 1 provides for a Treaty to be drafted and that governments would have to approve this Treaty. Therefore, although a discussion will show whether it will be possible to find a compromise, as suggested by Prof. Boyer, a compromise which would enable us to merge the basic substance of both

Let me make it quite clear from the outset that I would also strongly prefer not to have two scenarios, but only one and in that I can accept almost all the elements of Scenario B to be included in Scenario A, except - and I think that is the most striking difference - the creation of an ERF in the final stage. In the Skeleton Report on pages 5 and 6 three justifications are mentioned, President Pöhl referred to them, for a more substantial first step. I think all three of them can also be used for Scenario A and not only to defend Scenario B. All three, in a more balanced presentation, would be in support of Scenario A, strengthen Scenario A and not only for B. I must as a side remark say that I have some difficulty with the third justification and I do want to mention it, namely the tendency of the European central banks to conduct their monetary policies on the basis of differentials vis-à-vis other countries is not necessarily conducive to fostering a monetary policy satisfactory for the Community as a whole. This suggests by implication, and to be quite specific, that the Bundesbank has to weaken its monetary policy stance to become more European and that is something I would like to reject - but that is only a side remark. So the three justifications, with the side remark, I can see being used for Scenario A as well. Admittedly in his second presentation Governor de Larosière certainly provided a much more balanced account and proposal, with much more emphasis on co-ordination of policies and the need to gradually work towards that end. The only element is still the ERF in the first stage, which for various reasons I cannot accept. Also because as it has been said before it puts the emphasis at a very early stage at the wrong end. The main task of an ESCB, or whatever you may want to call it, the primary task is to promote domestic, European price stability, and here the first step would be to put all the emphasis on external stability, exchange rate stability. I think that is also as a signal the wrong order if we were to do that. But we could start with the learning process, we could start with creating the basis for analytical support, we could start also, I agree with President Boyer, with emphasising the necessity of independence of an ultimate ESCB by already pointing out to governments that they should take steps in those cases where their autonomy has not yet been sufficiently realised - they could do that already at an early stage. Only the centralisation of tasks of intervention of currencies is a matter of technical order, but not a principal thing at this stage and would provide the wrong signal, as I said.

In brief, Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we can forget about the letters A and B in our presentation, that we would be able to strengthen A. I could live with the suggestion of creating three sub-committees, one on supervision, one on exchange rates and one on a Federal policy, although I must say that in my mind exchange rate policies and monetary policies are so linked together that I do not clearly see the need to have two committees for that, but as a matter of compromise, if all others would want that, I could accept two committees for these two issues, but I would prefer to have it in one: exchange rate policy and monetary policy. I could accept that and therefore I would say that I would like to support Governors Pöhl and Leigh-Pemberton in their approach.","The later you speak, the briefer you can be, that is an advantage.

When you say divisibility, that means whether you can transfer part of decision power or you have to transfer almost all of it. On p.2 to 3 it is clearly stated that you cannot transfer part of a decision power, whereas on p.11 and 12 in Scenario A there is a proposal or suggestion that you can transfer part of decision-making power and in Scenario B the proposal on the ERF is also an example of transferring part of the power. What is the opinion? You cannot have both - p.1 and 2 where you give the wrong impression, the wrong signals to the market if you divide the decision-making power. I am in favour of p.1 and 2 and this means I think that it is simply a wrong structure to transfer part of decision-making power. It is simply not in line with efficient policy making. Therefore, I would support what has been mostly said that you try both to strengthen the work that can be done without changing the Treaty and that you prepare for a new Treaty in case that the Heads of State want to have the final goal of an economic and
monetary union. I have one suggestion, that is that you could tighten the demands or requests that you put on this Committee of central bank Governors by making it necessary for them to develop a set of rules that have to be followed by the various countries. You have convergence either by way of following a certain set of rules or by transferring decision-making power. If you agree that you cannot transfer part of the decision-making power but eventually only all of it, you could have some rules, and that underlines what Mr. Thygesen said that you could simply make a list of rules which the individual countries should follow. You could report on whether this has been fulfilled and you could see how gradually convergence becomes more efficient. This would mean, as Governor Godeaux once said, that you have to see things done, you can simply report whether these targets have been fulfilled. I have a list of the rules, you have exchange rate behaviour, monetary policy targets, budget targets, tax ?, social policy, cost development - you could have such a set of things where you say you have to follow these rules. This would put pressure both on the monetary authorities and on the political authorities in charge of fiscal policy. In that way it would be a more efficient step towards the second stage, but I think we have to be very clear about whether we think you can transfer with efficiency part of decision-making power.

The first point I would like to make is that I am certainly of the view of those who believe that
it is absolutely essential that we come out with one scenario. I think it would be a great pity if we came out with two scenarios, it would be a pity for the credibility of the Committee and its members and it may derail further discussions into directions which I would prefer to avoid. That is just one general remark.

My second remark - and I am coming now to the substance - is that clearly the major problem here is whether in the first stage you should or should not have an institutional change. I think that is, as Mr. Andriessen said, at the heart of our debate. Let me begin by saying that I do have a fairly fundamental sympathy for an institutional approach, but I will qualify that in a minute. The reason for this sympathy is that an institutional change has a symbolic value and symbols are extremely important, you shouldn't underestimate that, that institutions do carry constraints and I have a reading of the EMS experience in which I think that the constraining element has played a major role in shaping the convergence of policy decisions. Therefore the greater constraint we have, the more institutions we have, the greater the possibility of effective convergences. This is the reason why my sympathy, and I must state very clearly, goes for the thrust of the argument set forward by J. de Larosière. However, I must say immediately that I have a second priority also and that is a speedy change in the effective monetary policy co-operation and general policy co-operation among the member countries. My own reading of the present situation is that a speedy change is at least as important, and perhaps even more important, than an institutional change. I am extremely preoccupied by what might happen to the EMS, not in three years' time, but in one year and that is very much along the line of the argument because we have now gone very far in liberalising capital movements - I am happy with that and it is a fact. This liberalisation is happening in a world environment where expectations may run in all possible directions, where the speed of transmission of interest rate movements is extremely speedy, and because also I do see basic imbalances in terms of current accounts within the EMS. I think this has to be said very bluntly. We do have these basic imbalances and therefore things may happen within the EMS that will need a very very careful handling, not excluding perhaps exchange rate changes, etc. but it has to be under control, it will have to be put under control so as not to waste really ten years of very very successful experience. It is for this reason that I would be in favour of a first stage which could be implemented as quickly as possible and not in a two or three-year distant future, but starting this autumn or at least at the end of this year. If it appears that the creation of a Reserve Fund runs into institutional obstacles in individual countries or in terms of a Treaty, then my clear preference would be of a first stage, as outlined in Scenario A, appropriately beefed-up if I may say so by taking over all the elements of Scenario B, except the Reserve Fund. That would be my idea and that is the major, very practical reason for - despite my sympathies with B - being in favour of the first stage in Scenario A. Then the question would arise, how to go onto the second or first stage, but let me perhaps come back to that at a later stage.","Let me start by saying that I will try to be as clear as all my predecessors have been and I am very happy to see the way the discussion is going because we are really touching substance.

Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,1568 - 1686,1568,1686,118,,,,EN,"I wonder whether we have time for a second round of discussions, but I appreciate the discussion today because it really brings us to the concrete problems and to the set of proposals which we have to make. I want to limit myself only to a few remarks in response to what has been said around the table. Firstly, Mr. Thygesen, you referred to proposals on the
European Central Bank which you said I have made - I don't know to which proposals you are referring to, but I don't think we should discuss that today, this is a different chapter, we will discuss that next time I understand when we talk about the character of an ESCB. That was a misunderstanding what you said, that is not my view that the institution should only consist of the Board of Governors and that the Executive Board should have nothing to say. On the contrary, I think an ESCB should be constructed in my view very similarly to, let us say, the American system more than the German system. I would not advocate the German system as a model for many reasons which we can discuss when we come to that point. I am not convinced, frankly speaking, that the German system is the most optimal system, I think that the American system is much better than ours. But this is a different story and we will have to discuss that on a different occasion.

The point I want to emphasise and where I want to take a very different view from what has been said by some colleagues here around the table is the following. M. Rubio, Lamfalussy and others have made the same point: major institutional changes are necessary to take a step forward. I think that is a great misunderstanding if I may say that with all respect. I don't think we need major institutional changes, for instance, in order to avoid a crisis in the EMS if it would happen. We don't need a Reserve Fund, for instance, which wouldn't help to get a crisis under control. You said there is a crisis and therefore we need institutional changes - maybe I misunderstood you. What I think is really necessary to make progress towards a monetary union are, in the first place, decisions which can be taken on a national level today within the given legal framework. That is first of all, and I repeat what I have said many times before, but we have to say that in our Report very clearly in my view. Firstly, that the EMS has to be completed and all members states of the member countries of the EMS should join the EMS and fulfil the rules of the EMS and that goes of course for Britain and countries like Spain, which doesn't need any institutional change because we have the institution, we have the EMS, we have the rules and we have the Treaty on the EMS, it needs only a decision on the national level - in Italy you have to reduce the band, etc. That would be a major step forward towards a monetary union, a very substantial step, much more than any institutional change which we can envisage within the next two years.

The second thing has already been decided and that is the liberalisation which is a very very major step in the direction of a monetary union. It has been decided and it has to be implemented. Maybe that was a little undervalued in the public and in the markets and maybe we should emphasise this in our Reports.

The most important thing is that we should aim for, you called it a set of rules and I think that maybe we should call it a set of principles or a set of rules, but what is meant is that we are aiming for more convergence in economic performance. If we would recommend to the Council that all member states of the Community would commit themselves to a policy which would lead to inflation rates, let us say below 3% as an example, and to reduce their budget deficit to levels, let us say below 3% of GDP, very concrete steps which wouldn't need any institutional change but would be a very very major and substantial step in the direction of a monetary and economic union. These are the kind of recommendations we should not forget
in our Report. They are included, but I am of the opinion that we should make them much clearer, because we have to avoid the illusion that some institutional changes would bring about the kind of substantial improvements which we really need.

There is one point which I miss in our proposals and which I think we have to include. Talking about the first step I think we have to mention at some occasion that as long as divergences exist to the extent that we have them, realignments and changes in exchange rates have to be a legitimate instrument for the adjustment process. What was said about the imbalances in the EMS and the economies of the EEC, trade balances, current accounts, etc., it is of course absolutely obvious that there are these imbalances but we should not give the impression and fuel the illusion that by having more access to short-term financing, liquidity, reserve funds,
credit facilities, etc. that that would lead to less imbalances. On the contrary, the more we rely on intervention the less constraint there is to reduce the imbalances. As a last resort, of course, exchange rate changes should not be excluded as long as these imbalances exist, because otherwise all the pressures will be in other areas - wages, interest rates, etc. I think we should include one little paragraph on that problem.

One or two other points of lesser importance. What has been said about the strengthening of central banks' independence by Mr. Boyer, that is of course a very welcome suggestion, but I wonder whether we could ask our respective governments to strengthen our own positions. I want to be very frank in that respect, it is not applicable to those central banks which have a certain dependence to their governments and finance ministries, it goes also for myself because I am not as independent as people think I am. I am very dependent on the decisions of 18 people, my Council. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, Carlo, to agree to any kind of ex ante co-ordination, because legally I am maybe less able than others around this table to make any ex ante commitments as far as interest rates and exchange rates are concerned, because I cannot even decide on buying a stamp for a letter without the approval of the central bank Council - being very extreme. That is the legal position, fortunately it is different in practice otherwise I wouldn't be here. Legally and in a paper like this I couldn't agree to say that we have to aim for more ex ante co-ordination. Necessary as it is and in practice we have done it of course, I have announced to you interest rate changes in advance very often and it was made public even, not from here, but from others before it was decided. This was just a little footnote I wanted to make.

As far as co-ordination of monetary policy is concerned, that indeed is the main factor and the main thing we should aim for. The legal preconditions are already there if you read what has been said in 1964 in the Council Resolution which has lead to the establishment of the Council of Central Bank Governors, practically everything is said of what we are proposing. There is not really very much we can add and if you read the statutes of our group, of the Council of Central Bank Governors, you will recognise that we are already today enabled to give recommendations and to tell all the things we are stipulating here. But maybe, nevertheless, it would be a good thing to ask the Council to repeat and confirm that and to be a little more detailed and give a little more strength to this group of central banks and to authorise, so to say, the Central Bank Governors to make this kind of recommendation and maybe to upgrade our Committee also by, for instance, giving the Chairman a little more profile, increasing the research capacities, as Mr. Leigh-Pemberton suggested, increasing the staff, etc. If we would go further and envisage what you call the limited step, we would immediately approach ail the problems which we have to solve - fortunately not we but the governments and Parliaments have to solve when they start to negotiate a Treaty. You said that as a limited step, could you agree if this Reserve Fund would be independent, etc. But this causes a lot of problems, the independence of such a fund causes all the problems we have with a Treaty, so I don't think we should envisage two institutional steps. It is good enough and it is great progress, so to say, if we come out with a recommendation to the Council saying that we as a group recommend starting negotiations in the appropriate bodies, in the competent bodies, on a Treaty for, for instance, the statutes of an ESCB and the European economic and monetary union. But it is absolutely unrealistic to think that we could
do a little, as you call it limited step within two years which includes this kind of question, it is inconceivable and very unrealistic in most countries.","I wonder whether we have time for a second round of discussions, but I appreciate the discussion today because it really brings us to the concrete problems and to the set of proposals which we have to make. I want to limit myself only to a few remarks in response to what has been said around the table. Firstly, Mr. Thygesen, you referred to proposals on the
European Central Bank which you said I have made - I don't know to which proposals you are referring to, but I don't think we should discuss that today, this is a different chapter, we will discuss that next time I understand when we talk about the character of an ESCB. That was a misunderstanding what you said, that is not my view that the institution should only consist of the Board of Governors and that the Executive Board should have nothing to say. On the contrary, I think an ESCB should be constructed in my view very similarly to, let us say, the American system more than the German system. I would not advocate the German system as a model for many reasons which we can discuss when we come to that point. I am not convinced, frankly speaking, that the German system is the most optimal system, I think that the American system is much better than ours. But this is a different story and we will have to discuss that on a different occasion.

The point I want to emphasise and where I want to take a very different view from what has been said by some colleagues here around the table is the following. M. Rubio, Lamfalussy and others have made the same point: major institutional changes are necessary to take a step forward. I think that is a great misunderstanding if I may say that with all respect. I don't think we need major institutional changes, for instance, in order to avoid a crisis in the EMS if it would happen. We don't need a Reserve Fund, for instance, which wouldn't help to get a crisis under control. You said there is a crisis and therefore we need institutional changes - maybe I misunderstood you. What I think is really necessary to make progress towards a monetary union are, in the first place, decisions which can be taken on a national level today within the given legal framework. That is first of all, and I repeat what I have said many times before, but we have to say that in our Report very clearly in my view. Firstly, that the EMS has to be completed and all members states of the member countries of the EMS should join the EMS and fulfil the rules of the EMS and that goes of course for Britain and countries like Spain, which doesn't need any institutional change because we have the institution, we have the EMS, we have the rules and we have the Treaty on the EMS, it needs only a decision on the national level - in Italy you have to reduce the band, etc. That would be a major step forward towards a monetary union, a very substantial step, much more than any institutional change which we can envisage within the next two years.

The second thing has already been decided and that is the liberalisation which is a very very major step in the direction of a monetary union. It has been decided and it has to be implemented. Maybe that was a little undervalued in the public and in the markets and maybe we should emphasise this in our Reports.

The most important thing is that we should aim for, you called it a set of rules and I think that maybe we should call it a set of principles or a set of rules, but what is meant is that we are aiming for more convergence in economic performance. If we would recommend to the Council that all member states of the Community would commit themselves to a policy which would lead to inflation rates, let us say below 3% as an example, and to reduce their budget deficit to levels, let us say below 3% of GDP, very concrete steps which wouldn't need any institutional change but would be a very very major and substantial step in the direction of a monetary and economic union. These are the kind of recommendations we should not forget
in our Report. They are included, but I am of the opinion that we should make them much clearer, because we have to avoid the illusion that some institutional changes would bring about the kind of substantial improvements which we really need.

There is one point which I miss in our proposals and which I think we have to include. Talking about the first step I think we have to mention at some occasion that as long as divergences exist to the extent that we have them, realignments and changes in exchange rates have to be a legitimate instrument for the adjustment process. What was said about the imbalances in the EMS and the economies of the EEC, trade balances, current accounts, etc., it is of course absolutely obvious that there are these imbalances but we should not give the impression and fuel the illusion that by having more access to short-term financing, liquidity, reserve funds,
credit facilities, etc. that that would lead to less imbalances. On the contrary, the more we rely on intervention the less constraint there is to reduce the imbalances. As a last resort, of course, exchange rate changes should not be excluded as long as these imbalances exist, because otherwise all the pressures will be in other areas - wages, interest rates, etc. I think we should include one little paragraph on that problem.

One or two other points of lesser importance. What has been said about the strengthening of central banks' independence by Mr. Boyer, that is of course a very welcome suggestion, but I wonder whether we could ask our respective governments to strengthen our own positions. I want to be very frank in that respect, it is not applicable to those central banks which have a certain dependence to their governments and finance ministries, it goes also for myself because I am not as independent as people think I am. I am very dependent on the decisions of 18 people, my Council. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, Carlo, to agree to any kind of ex ante co-ordination, because legally I am maybe less able than others around this table to make any ex ante commitments as far as interest rates and exchange rates are concerned, because I cannot even decide on buying a stamp for a letter without the approval of the central bank Council - being very extreme. That is the legal position, fortunately it is different in practice otherwise I wouldn't be here. Legally and in a paper like this I couldn't agree to say that we have to aim for more ex ante co-ordination. Necessary as it is and in practice we have done it of course, I have announced to you interest rate changes in advance very often and it was made public even, not from here, but from others before it was decided. This was just a little footnote I wanted to make.

As far as co-ordination of monetary policy is concerned, that indeed is the main factor and the main thing we should aim for. The legal preconditions are already there if you read what has been said in 1964 in the Council Resolution which has lead to the establishment of the Council of Central Bank Governors, practically everything is said of what we are proposing. There is not really very much we can add and if you read the statutes of our group, of the Council of Central Bank Governors, you will recognise that we are already today enabled to give recommendations and to tell all the things we are stipulating here. But maybe, nevertheless, it would be a good thing to ask the Council to repeat and confirm that and to be a little more detailed and give a little more strength to this group of central banks and to authorise, so to say, the Central Bank Governors to make this kind of recommendation and maybe to upgrade our Committee also by, for instance, giving the Chairman a little more profile, increasing the research capacities, as Mr. Leigh-Pemberton suggested, increasing the staff, etc. If we would go further and envisage what you call the limited step, we would immediately approach ail the problems which we have to solve - fortunately not we but the governments and Parliaments have to solve when they start to negotiate a Treaty.

I will submit two questions to you and I will express them as clearly as possible. Two questions which I would like to submit to you as clearly as possible and as frankly as possible. My first question, as Governor Doyle said, there are not only two possible solutions that can be envisaged, there are many such approaches. Let me take an example - no, it is not an example, a decision is required here. For the time being the Report proposes to the European Council to decide as soon as it is able to do this that a Treaty be drafted on economic and monetary union, just as the European Council of Milan in 1985 decided to amend the Treaty of Rome as to the modalities covering decisions and as to the objectives of the Treaty. I can assure you that had that decision not been reached we would not be moving so quickly in the direction of the implementation of the single European market, not to mention the other two objectives. Where this proposal will be in front of the Council it may be very possible for one or the other Head of Government to say I don't want a Treaty, that is why Governor Doyle says that there are many different approaches that can be envisaged. But, and this afternoon we want confirmation before we draft, as soon as the European Council has the proposal for it, we assume it will decide that a Treaty will have to be drafted. Then the Council will say six months were necessary to arrive at the Single European Act which is very complicated, here it is simpler and all we need is an intergovernmental conference which will prepare this Treaty, which will complement the Treaty of Rome. Those who want a Treaty fall into two parties, there are two schools of thought so to speak, there are those who say that once the Heads of Government have politically undertaken to bring about economic and monetary union, you don't need a first step which will be tantamount to a qualitative leap to be very frank, you can take the first step of Scenario A since you know that the governments have politically undertaken to bring about economic and monetary union. Then there is the other school of thought, people who are a little more suspicious in their minds, people who will say yes alright but right from the start one ought to have this qualitative leap to use Governor Ciampi's words. This first step, therefore, would imply legislative procedures, either after a statement issued by the European Council, each government would include in its national legislation what is necessary in order to make this first step possible. For instance, harmonisation of the statutes of central banks, plus, if we follow Governor de Larosière's suggestion, the setting-up of this Fund or the second’ solution, there is an intergovernmental agreement which is then submitted for ratification to parliament. But in either case the national parliaments will have a word to say. On the first hypothesis one would make a first step with domestic legislative changes, but this would really mean that you would have to go to your national parliaments twice, once for this first step, and secondly, you would have to get your parliament to ratify the Treaty. I will put the question as bluntly as I can and I am not going to say that you are going to sleep over this, but you are going to eat over this and while you are
eating you will think about this whole thing hopefully, so that after lunch we shall be able to come up with a decision. Do we propose a Treaty? Do we then identify a first stage which will satisfy everybody or not, bearing in mind what I have just said? The undertaking to finalise a Treaty with a deadline by when the Treaty will have to be ready and a deadline by when the European Council would have to approve this Treaty, this is what I did about 1992, I think this gives one serious guarantees, a priori at least as I see it now, but perhaps there are a few arguments which escape me. If we agreed on this then what we would have to do is to specify the contents of this first stage. So I would like to ask you to think about this and we will resume at 14.30.","Before adjourning the meeting I would like to suggest something and I hope that this will help us move forward.

5,1/10/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",453,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,20 - 163,20,163,143,2,1,,EN,"It seems to me, at least this is my personal opinion, that this morning's discussion was very fruitful and, as you wished, and if we are going to have an equally fruitful discussion on the second Section of the Report, amended to take into account the remarks made in the last meeting, we shall have erected the two basic pillars on which the Report will rest. At the end of this morning's session I had left you with a couple of remarks which were tantamount to questions.

The first question was: does the Committee feel that in order to move towards economic and monetary union a Treaty is necessary right from the start? This is what we said in this draft Report, but some have rightly complained that this is mentioned just in passing in the sentence while describing the two scenarios. Perhaps one ought to make this point with greater emphasis because I think that this will somewhat dampen down the difference in opinion between those who defend Scenario A and those who defend Scenario B. Now a Treaty, and I think that we would have to say this, that for each stage - one, two and three - there will be a deadline. We have done this for the EMS though not very successfully. Just indicate the various stages is what we did so that one can satisfy those who say that one cannot build this economic and monetary union under circumstances which run counter to the project. This I think is an important point which ought to be made in the Report and which might, perhaps, get the Heads of Government to understand what lies behind it all. If there is a Treaty then the credibility of this union will be put in different terms to what they would be if there were no Treaty. However, there would then remain a certain controversy. Some will say, since there is a Treaty and the Treaty is important I have concretely seen the impact of the Single Act which has imposed sufficient constraints on governments to make progress possible - institutional objectives, their definition or moving towards them. As an academic I would say that without the Single Act we would not have moved forward as quickly towards the implementation of the single market. If I may give an example, if the Governor of the Bank of Greece allows me to do this, one says sometimes there are great presidencies and there are smaller presidencies, one might say that the Greek presidency was perhaps not one of the greatest, but under the Greek presidency 30 decisions concerning the market were reached, 10% of all the decisions necessary to bring about the single market were made. This of course is the merit of Greece but also of the Single Act. Therefore, I do believe that the very existence of a Treaty changes the situation.

But after that there are still two points of view which remain and this is my second question. Treaty and the first phase and I think the first phase will have to coincide with 1st July 1990, liberalisation of capital movements between 8 countries and I think that many politicians are
of this opinion for reasons of consistency. This first phase, one can start implementing it before the Treaty is approved because no changes are required here. This is what is described in Scenario A, reinforced perhaps by some of the ideas to be found in Scenario B. President Pöhl has made a very important reference to the Decision of 1964. The Decision of 1964 can be taken as it stands or amended somewhat, but one member here said that if the European Council confirms the Decision of 1964, it will give more weight to it, it will make it more solemn and may even add something to it, and some of you this morning said the Committee of Governors would find their role is strengthened as far as the subjects which fall within their competence are concerned. They might submit recommendations and the Committee of Governors might be supplied with a Secretariat or some permanent sub-committees. This morning, although you don't all agree on the number of committees necessary, you have referred to banking supervision, exchange rate policy and monetary policy and this would complete the first stage which would not require any legislative changes at national level. There are the others who say alright even if there is a Treaty we believe that the necessary impulse requires a qualitative leap right from the start, which requires, as I said this morning, legislative change and going before national Parliaments twice. Those in favour of the second thesis will say, in any case you will have to go before the national Parliaments in order to change the statutes of central banks, why not at the same time get through measures which would make it possible to implement Scenario B as far as phase number 1 is concerned? Personally, I still think that Scenario A, if there is a Treaty, if the political decision of drafting a Treaty is made, Scenario A strengthened by some of the elements submitted by Governor de Larosière would mean that as of 1st July 1990 we would already have a great deal of credibility and this would enable the Committee of Governors to move forward much further, this is my own personal conviction. Could one reach a tentative agreement on this point? We could then devote the rest of this afternoon to a chapter-by-chapter examination of Section III, after which we can perhaps move on to the ECU, which I said earlier on has to be dealt with separately. I am sorry if I wasn't quite clear before lunch, perhaps you were also too hungry, but in order to help the discussion along I add that if we propose that there be a Treaty and if the political decision to draft a Treaty is reached and if this Treaty is produced
quickly, then the Scenario A, as enriched, will be enough to give us credibility, will give enough consistency to the Report and will result in the Report carrying enough conviction. I agree with you when you say that we don't want two scenarios in this, although having the two scenarios has produced this fruitful discussion which we would not otherwise have had. That is what I propose for the immediate future this afternoon before we move on to another exercise.","It seems to me, at least this is my personal opinion, that this morning's discussion was very fruitful and, as you wished, and if we are going to have an equally fruitful discussion on the second Section of the Report, amended to take into account the remarks made in the last meeting, we shall have erected the two basic pillars on which the Report will rest.

Duisenberg,Wim Duisenberg,271 - 296,271,296,25,,,,EN,"Mr. Chairman, perhaps at our last session in April we should conclude our deliberations by agreeing on a draft communiqué for the European Council, which would say: we the European Council have decided to work towards economic and monetary union as fast as possible, we have understood from the Report we have received from our special Committee that this requires a change in the Treaty. We have decided to set the change in the Treaty in motion immediately. In the meantime we are convinced that we need, in order to prepare for that stage, a maximum of convergence of our economic performance and therefore intensification of the co-ordination of our fiscal and monetary policies. We are committed to doing so and we request the central banks of the Community also to take the maximum steps
within the institutional framework, pending the change of the Treaty, to promote this further convergence.

My answer would be to let the Heads of State agree on a change in the Treaty and do it immediately.
","Mr. Chairman, perhaps at our last session in April we should conclude our deliberations by agreeing on a draft communiqué for the European Council, which would say: we the European Council have decided to work towards economic and monetary union as fast as possible, we have understood from the Report we have received from our special Committee that this requires a change in the Treaty. We have decided to set the change in the Treaty in motion immediately. In the meantime we are convinced that we need, in order to prepare for that stage, a maximum of convergence of our economic performance and therefore intensification of the co-ordination of our fiscal and monetary policies. We are committed to doing so and we request the central banks of the Community also to take the maximum steps
within the institutional framework, pending the change of the Treaty, to promote this further convergence. That may entail setting up committees on exchange rate and monetary policy, harmonisation of the supervisory rules through a committee. My answer would be to let the Heads of State agree on a change in the Treaty and do it immediately.

I had two points on which I wanted to make a remark.

Firstly, when the Rapporteurs come to my idea I just wanted to make it clear that at the very end of p.4, it is said in contrast to Scenario B only, in Scenario B only those countries which fully participate in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS would participate in the ERF. Now I know that this is not going to remain as such because we are not going to have two scenarios, but what is important is that I make my point clear.

That is the idea of this apparent discrimination, there is a reason of substance so I wanted that to be reflected somewhere.

My second point is a question more than anything else. It is the idea that is in brackets somewhere, I think it is on p.10 - no it's not in brackets it is the figure that is in brackets.

Page 10, to follow up on Governor de Larosière's remark under the heading EMS arrangements at the top. Taking the square brackets and the remark about fluctuating margins together, this seems to me to be some contradiction here. The question is asked, or the suggestion is made, to strengthen the credit mechanisms. That is not entirely consistent I think with narrowing the fluctuation margins, because if there is still a great danger of destabilising capital flows then apparently convergence is yet insufficient to eliminate the feel in the markets for changes in parities, and strengthening credit will not help convergence it will postpone convergence rather than help convergence. The possibilities to narrow the fluctuation margins are also determined by the measure of convergence. I would think that significant progress in economic convergence is a precondition for narrower margins, and I would plead to reformulate it in that sense.

On page 11, the second indent from the top, it says the centre would also take a view on the exchange rates of the Community vis-à-vis major third currencies. I ask myself what is the operational meaning of this, because the main instruments to influence the relationship to third currencies are in the hands, still at this stage, of the national central banks - that is these interest rate policies and interventions. So I ask myself what is the meaning of the centre taking a view here? I would like the Rapporteurs to think about that one.

My final remark is on page 12 that the task of the ESCB would be … and then the first full paragraph/dash: to represent the Community together with representatives of national central banks in international monetary meetings. If this is meant literally it is meant to be that the centre is empowered to take a position on behalf of the Community. Then the question arises, how this is compatible with national central banks also taking part in this international fora? The centre on behalf of all of us and we ourselves on behalf of ourselves, there it seems to me is a possibility for friction and I would ask you to think about that one as
well.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, although it is not in order I would like to say that I support - I disagree with Governor de Larosière and I support him that the thought of some addition is being included and I also support Governor Pöhl's view that other governors then also say why they do not like the idea.","Three remarks on p.10, 11 and 12.

The centre on behalf of all of us and we ourselves on behalf of ourselves, there it seems to me is a possibility for friction and I would ask you to think about that one as
well.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, although it is not in order I would like to say that I support - I disagree with Governor de Larosière and I support him that the thought of some addition is being included and I also support Governor Pöhl's view that other governors then also say why they do not like the idea."

The bottom of page 4, which Governor de Larosière averted to earlier where he was talking about Scenario B: only certain countries shall participate in the ERF, and we can skip the background explanation of that, but on p.10 then again - this is stage 1 we are still talking about - all member countries in a position to do so - admittedly in square brackets - would become participants in the exchange rate mechanism. Yet, nothing more is said again on the exchange rate mechanism question until you come to p.12 where it says: the beginning of this final stage (this is stage 3) would be marked by the definite locking of parities. I have no quarrel with that but I am left wondering if it is really wise or even practical in a situation where some currencies in effect would be fully floating from stage 1 right up to stage 3 and then would be expected overnight to become locked into a totally irrevocable mechanism.

The other side of that coin is at the bottom of p.10, and again this harks back to my concern about parallelism, the last two indents on p.10 talking about the CEPC would be responsible for adoption of medium-term guidelines for key financial targets and economic programmes, the joint adoption of which, etc. I think stage 2 is much too late for that part to become live, I think that notion has to be brought into stage 1 to achieve any kind of parallelism in the thing at all.

Once there is very good convergence between inflation rates, the exchange rates are going to be practically fixed so the currencies can be perfect substitutes for one another and hence the ECU won't be terribly useful. It will be useful only at the last stage, during the final stage when one has a single currency. Now there is some doubt as to the usefulness of the ECU throughout the process before the terminal stage. Gresham's law will apply throughout, before the final stage the ECU is not going to be terribly useful. As for monetary control technique, the supply of currency by the Community as such and by its member countries, perhaps, this is not something that ought to be dealt with in detail in the Report. One could of course produce a highly technical Report detailing the best means of control, the principles and co-ordination that would be necessary, implying a transfer of sovereignty. So the techniques of controlling monetary supply, I think that one could leave this to a discussion of the Committee of Governors or the central bank at that time and not to try and think too much about such methods now. Since Mr. Lamfalussy raised the question and there is a very interesting proposal on this by Governor Ciampi. Should there be a quantitative control of the monetary base or should one follow the American example, the open market system, to deal with the money base. Once there is a common monetary policy the only thing one would be able to envisage is to give certain directives to central banks as to what the expansion that is desirable is like and then give them a free hand to achieve this. Another alternative, a quantitative control. What is difficult to envisage is open market transactions at a European scale in order to control the monetary base, but I think that we can leave this to the technical discussion between central banks which will take place whenever these matters will be pertinent and we should concentrate on more general matters of a less technical nature.","I think that the subject dealt with in Governor Ciampi's paper seems to indicate that the ECU is not going to be very useful before there is convergence between inflation rates.

Robert Leigh-Pemberton,Robin Leigh-Pemberton,1460 - 1501,1460,1501,41,,,,EN,"May I just make some comments first of all on what Wim Duisenberg said about the monetary base and the use of that in what I understand of Carlo's suggestions for a monetary control technique in the Community. Wim said that we had tried the monetary base technique in the UK, we actually haven't ever got as far as using it, we considered it some time back but we didn't think then that it would be a useful technique in the UK and it is my feeling, and our feeling generally in the Bank of England, that it would be even less likely to work well on a pan-European scale. The reason for this is, of course, the case for monetary base control really rests heavily on the assumption or the existence of a stable relationship between demand for the monetary base and the wider monetary aggregates or other key economic variables at work in the economy. Not only that that stable relationship exists, but it will also remain stable when the authorities act upon it. We have come to the conclusion in the UK that that relationship does not actually survive either in developing economic situations, or least of all when the authorities start to work on it. If I may go on from there, I don't think Carlo says this explicitly in his paper, but it seems logical from what he says to assume that national
central banks under the system that he envisages would seek to control national monetary bases by means of compulsory reserves. You will either have to hand in reserves or you will be allocated increased reserves according to your need. Surely the difficulty here is that compulsory reserves are in effect a sort of tax on banking and that the banks will therefore seek ways of mitigating the liability for the tax, or alternatively the effect of the control on their monetary base. It may be that there will be fewer opportunities or less incentives to avoid the
liability if there is not a well-developed money market, if capital movements are restricted, and if the banking system operates as a sheltered cartel or enjoys a special relationship with the government, but certainly in the UK none of these conditions are met at the moment and it seems to me that if we move into a European Community with full liberalisation of capital movements and the completion of the internal market in financial services, it is unlikely that those conditions will apply in the future Community either. I therefore feel sceptical about the effectiveness of the sort of monetary control that your system envisages through this method of the control of bank's reserves. I am sorry to come to that conclusion but I think that that is what would happen and in putting this forward I draw rather on mostly the experience and considerations to be had in the UK on this very subject. While I am talking about experience in the UK may I endorse what Mr. Doyle has said about the change in a currency, there is no doubt that when we went to decimalisation ordinary retailers, almost universally, used it as a means of increasing their prices and this may be a long way ahead in the Community, but we have got to recognise that unless we are ingenious in some way or another we shall have just the same experience here. People round up their prices instinctively. I have got various other points to make, really which come on the matter of a common currency in general, but I think I shall stop there for the moment because they are rather different points on the way the discussion is at the moment.","May I just make some comments first of all on what Wim Duisenberg said about the monetary base and the use of that in what I understand of Carlo's suggestions for a monetary control technique in the Community.

I wonder whether the experience of monetary base control of a central bank vis-à-vis its own private banks is relevant in this context. What we are talking about here is a relationship between an international or European system in the national central banks.

Think about a situation in which there are no foreign exchange controls, and therefore banks can borrow freely from overseas to supplement their base.) The question is what the Bank of England can do to get itself official ECUs in the proposed system. It is a relationship between a European monetary authority and the national central banks, rather than between the national banks and their private domestic banks.

some stage that the system may be too tight and therefore they discuss p.10 and onwards on the methods of introducing more flexibility in the way in which national central banks can by exchanging ? the foreign exchange reserves, obtain some more official ECU. But they cannot do so even in the most liberalised system. That will be seen by some as a virtue of this system, but I think the approach is right.

My understanding of his proposal is that it would apply, of course it could apply, to the final stage, but it would also or could also apply at the end or in stage 2. In other terms at a time when exchange rates could still be changed. Take that situation and look into that situation. If you take his proposal, this would mean that the balance sheet of the individual central banks as expressed in ECUs would be under the control of the central fund in ECUs, there would be a formal relationship. In other words, the ability of the individual central banks to expand the balance sheet would be limited by the supply of the central ECUs to the central bank. Let us imagine that we have very different monetary control techniques in the individual central banks vis-à-vis their own banking systems, and you can perfectly well imagine that the relationship between the own balance sheet of the individual central banks and the domestic money supply ... relations not only are different from country to country but move in a different direction - this is perfectly possible with the sort of deregulator system we have, we may have a velocity circulation difference.

I think that the ECU has a name which is already a virtue in itself, markets have got used to it, central bank reserves hold a non-negligible amount of ECUs in their reserves - several billion - therefore it seems to me a rather good idea to give an imprimatur to the ECU. I think it is an easy way of thereby obtaining matrix for the future European currency and hence I am very much in agreement with this idea. As for the system proposed by Governor Ciampi, I think that the most interesting thing perhaps in his proposal is paragraph 19, the one which says that the central institution will have to decide each year how much money and credit should be created in a community in order to support economic activity in a non-inflationary environment. This really is the core idea, it is this which will give body to the common monetary policy. He proposes a system which as I have said is one among other systems, this system has great faith in one relationship, the relationship between what one calls the monetary basis, notes in circulation of reserves on the one hand, and monetary aggregates on the other. Experience there is as far as that relationship is concerned, and anyway one would say that this kind of relationship is not terribly reliable. Like Governor Duisenberg I think that one should not reject this out of hand because one would have to find at the European level systems to control monetary creation in each one of our countries. This system as proposed is a simplistic one, rather automatic one, but which may have the virtue of simplifying matters. My thoughts are not yet firm on this. I think that Alexandre was right to point out that one may run into difficulties although I think that the
problems he referred to might be taken care of by having special reserves and having a deal of flexibility. Mr. Ciampi's paper indicates that they themselves got cold feet about the rigid character of their system and introduced a certain degree of flexibility. I think it is interesting to
refer to this kind of thinking. Everybody talks about ECU creation as being one way of getting the European monetary system to make progress and we have just said that the idea of rejecting a parallel currency, the ECU, to the present system was not a good idea, it is an important thing that we have said here and I agree also that this injection is not a good idea. It
is not going to get the system to move, it is a rather complicated idea and a somewhat disturbing idea, but it is not enough for us to say this.

I think that Ciampi's proposal is very interesting and that we should include that in our further considerations, but this is something for the future so to say. I have one little intellectual problem, that is if you have a European institution which is able to control the money supply, the room for manoeuvre for national central banks, then I ask myself why do you need national central banks in such a system? Why can't you say then we have a European central bank and we don't need national central banks because the national central banks have practically no function anymore, they are not able to pursue anything which could be called an autonomous monetary policy. They are only branches of this European institution, which can of course use the ECU as the European currency. I agree with what Lamfalussy said that finally if you have locked exchange rates, at least from an aesthetic point of view, it would be nicer to have a common currency instead of 12 national currencies which are locked. That is a little futuristic if I may say so. We can say in our Report that the ECU can become the European currency in the final stage or something along those lines, and that the ECU could be used as a monetary instrument, something in that direction. I have no objection to that.

The second point is that we should take a rather positive attitude towards the ECU, I agree with that. We should say that we have learnt that there a private market has been developed for ECUs, it is an instrument so to say amongst others. Interesting enough to me is the statistics we learned about, and it is not those countries which have no restrictions, where the ECU is used most, it is exactly the opposite, countries like Holland and Germany where you have no restrictions on the use of ECUs at all, you have no capital controls, no exchange controls, the relevance of the ECU is practically nil. In other countries, like Italy, Belgium where you have had until recently some kind of restriction the ECU was more popular because, in the case of Italy I think it is very obvious it was an instrument to avoid the restrictions on capital controls. I wonder if in a fully liberalised system, a deregulated system with free capital movement the ECU will play a significant role. I think it will deteriorate, but that remains to be seen and we should tell the public that we as a group are of the opinion that there is no reason to restrict the use of this instrument.

On the official use of commercial ECUs, we have taken the decision to enable the Swiss National Bank to hold official ECUs - I think it was a good decision and I am in favour of that. If we could persuade other central banks in the world - in Japan, the US - to hold ECUs instead of DM or sterling, that would be fine. I don't think it will play a major role but if that would be developed as a European instrument it would be fine with me and we can say that in our Report. It has also some relevance if we say it. Having said that we should not forget the conclusions in Duisenberg's paper which are I think very important and which means that this concept of a parallel currency is really ""ein Irrweg"" and that then the discussion will be finished. That is also very important. The question of the link between the official and the private ECU that is something we have to discuss in the Council of Governors maybe in more detail, but that is also a concept which I think we should come to a conclusion. At least I would insist on a statement, a paragraph, saying that this is not conceivable as long as the responsibilities and the powers of a European institution which issues is not defined. In other words before we have a European central bank system you cannot envisage an institution which is responsible for the control of the private ECU, because it means that central banks are responsible for the currency of other central banks, this I think is a very far-reaching concept. That is the third conclusion in Mr. Duisenberg's paper and I think we should also take note in our Report of this conclusion. Having said that, maybe we will destroy some illusions about the ECU in political circles and in the European Parliament, but on the other hand maybe we can add some realism and could put it in the right dimension this instrument. That would be good and I would appreciate that.","I fully agree with what Governor de Larosière said.

On the official use of commercial ECUs, we have taken the decision to enable the Swiss National Bank to hold official ECUs - I think it was a good decision and I am in favour of that. If we could persuade other central banks in the world - in Japan, the US - to hold ECUs instead of DM or sterling, that would be fine. I don't think it will play a major role but if that would be developed as a European instrument it would be fine with me and we can say that in our Report. It has also some relevance if we say it. Having said that we should not forget the conclusions in Duisenberg's paper which are I think very important and which means that this concept of a parallel currency is really ""ein Irrweg"" and that then the discussion will be finished. That is also very important. The question of the link between the official and the private ECU that is something we have to discuss in the Council of Governors maybe in more detail, but that is also a concept which I think we should come to a conclusion. At least I would insist on a statement, a paragraph, saying that this is not conceivable as long as the responsibilities and the powers of a European institution which issues is not defined. In other words before we have a European central bank system you cannot envisage an institution which is responsible for the control of the private ECU, because it means that central banks are responsible for the currency of other central banks, this I think is a very far-reaching concept. That is the third conclusion in Mr. Duisenberg's paper and I think we should also take note in our Report of this conclusion. Having said that, maybe we will destroy some illusions about the ECU in political circles and in the European Parliament, but on the other hand maybe we can add some realism and could put it in the right dimension this instrument. That would be good and I would appreciate that."

We will have to explain why we are not in favour of a parallel currency, why we are interested in the further development of the ECU, which would be one of the reasons why we would advocate the abandonment of any constraints and
restraints as to its use. How do we handle the link between the public and the private ECU during the different phases? I think that is important and that it ought to be said. Then this being said we still have to answer three questions it seems to me.

Firstly, what will one say to those who quite imprudently say that by promoting the use of the ECU in every shape and form one helps to bring about economic and monetary union. If our Report says nothing about this then not later than 8 days after its publication so-called eminent personalities would come forth and will say, but the Committee have missed the secret solution to achieve this economic and monetary union, namely the ECU, without at all saying whether they are thinking about the private ECU, the public ECU or anything of that nature. One has to supply oneself with the necessary ammunition to kill this kind of thing. Once we reach the final stage and once we have said that the ECU might very well become a common currency, how would that work in the light of what we know now? Governor Ciampi has made a contribution, are there any others who have a contribution to make?

Thirdly, from the point of view of monetary policy we find ourselves in a peculiar situation. Many confess that in view of the internationalisation and growing interdependence between markets, because of financial and technical innovations, it becomes more and more difficult for a national central bank to be in full technical and intellectual control of monetary policy, let alone economic policy. At the same time we are here trying to build a structure at the top of which there is going to be some sort of Federal institution and some sort of European Central Bank, and what is it going to do? Is it just going to issue recommendations? What are its links going to be with national central banks? Even more politically, what answer are we going to give those who say, obviously we see that this Committee comprised mainly central bank governors, they have concentrated more on monetary union, but they haven't explained at all how they would be able to cope with this difficulty of controlling money supply. What monetary policy? This last point is not strictly connected with the Report we have to submit, but in view of what is going to happen to our Report, and if we don't want to be criticised by people who say, monetary policy has become of secondary importance, or people who are going to critics internationalisation of markets or the liberalisation of capital movements, we must be prepared to answer them. Everybody seems to be in favour of liberalisation of capital movements here, in favour of a European financial services market and what instruments do we have to remain in control? We have to give an answer to such a question. A great deal still remains to be done on this and if you could think about this between now and the next meeting, this would be very helpful. At the next meeting we would pick up this discussion again. Perhaps the Rapporteurs would put all these questions onto one page, quite an informal piece of paper which will be called ""A propos de l'ECU"", questions about the ECU. Then we shall discuss regional policy, now we know that this is an essential element and you have already received Gov. Doyle's paper on this and as I had said at the beginning of the work of this Committee, I have asked experts to send in contributions and now we have to produce a synthesis from this and we shouldn't forget also about what has already been decided within the Community. Finally, we are going to look at the revised version of Section II. If we manage to go through all of this on 14th February, perhaps we might start at 10.30, we have to be careful about the outsiders who are members of our Committee, we might perhaps complete this and then we would have two full meetings in which we are going to read through the Report line by line and thus we shall hopefully complete our work in good time. The Secretaries and I myself have certainly taken on board your words of advice about being careful not to have an imbalanced Report, to be too detailed about some matters and not enough about others, not to go into details which are not for Heads of State or for heads of government, but at the same time to muster sound arguments on critical matters. We have critics who have always issued serious reservations about the very idea of trying to build Europe through the currency. As for Section II, when we reread it you will have to think about this balance between economic union and monetary union and the idea of an economic co-operation centre, this terminology will disappear. We are going to come forward with another proposal which will make use of existing bodies. I don't know whether you
agree with me, but if you create two supranational centres and economic and monetary centres then the whole thing becomes totally unrealistic.","I think that there were three common conclusions which have been referred to by President Pöhl right at the start of this discussion.

I think one cannot expect countries to go over to this irrevocable locking of parities if there is not an operational framework, which would be determined by these emerging institutions that would be in charge of monetary policy. This operational framework must be defined. I think that progressively one will have to move towards a global vision of the objectives of monetary policy for all the participants, in other words, one would have to have a clear idea as to what one wants to have in terms of the average price level, what one wants in terms of growth targets and exchange rate targets, and one must ensure that each participating country will move towards these overall targets and objectives, that there be true convergence and that this or that country do not deviate. In order to ensure that there won't be deviations one will have to have controlling mechanisms, supervisory mechanisms in Stage 2 already. These mechanisms cannot be described in too much detail in our Report but the emerging body must be able to control the liquidity of each economy, domestic credit (as said by Mr. Thygesen), foreign indebtedness, which is one of the ways in which one could try and escape from monetary policy. In our Report we will have to include a few paragraphs dealing with this. I don't think that one can describe in too much detail how possible deviations might be measured, but Mr. Ciampi’s idea must be reflected, namely that we shall need an operational framework in order to implement this monetary policy.

I think that we might perhaps agree to the following. In the Report itself we would state, firstly, that the existence of a parallel currency appears to us to be neither useful nor desirable. I would remove, for my own part, in the Rapporteurs' note the last lines for the reasons given by President Pöhl. President Pöhl said what will the ECU be after n years, is it still going to be a basket of currencies, or will it be a sui generis currency? We do not want to have a drafting which would lead one to think that the basket solution is immortal. What the group I think agrees to is that they do not want there to be a parallel currency. This is very important for subsequent discussions, also with experts. Then we also state that one day the ECU will become the only currency of the Community, and I think we had already agreed to this at the last meeting. Thirdly, somewhere in the Report - never mind where - we say that all the obstacles in the path of the voluntary use of the ECU should be removed in order to give a chance to the private ECU. The obstacles - I don't have the technical note that I had prepared, but I noticed that there were many such obstacles and that it is possible that some countries - totally sovereign of course - may take steps in order to encourage the ECU. I would stop at that. Secondly, in an annex, which of course would be less binding than the main body of the Report, we might list the possibilities which exist in order to have the minimum degree of common policies that one would like to have in the final stage, and in this annex one might describe the possible role of the ECU, but there are other means too as described by other speakers. This would be in the annex and I will see if the Rapporteurs would be able to produce this annex which would be appended to the Report. There is a last point, which we will consider at the next meeting and which I might summarise as follows, but I really submit this to you for consideration. In what way can phase 2 prepare phase 3 in a dynamic manner? We will discuss this next time. Some of you said that they were concerned by the fact that they didn't quite see what role was going to be played by phase 2 - one understands very well what phase 1 is going to do, one can also see what phase 3 is going to do, but what does phase 2 do? I suggest that we discuss that next time in order not to complicate matters here. I conclude that we will have to find arguments which will enable us to give replies to M. Giscard d'Estaing and Mr. Schmidt who will say you have underestimated the role of the ECU, you have underestimated the contribution that the ECU could have given to the construction of a European economic and monetary union.

We may think about this over lunch - and the Rapporteurs will think about it too - but there are three important points on which we don't have to think any more. There are three questions which deserve being thought about and I am just going to raise them and submit them to you. The first one has been raised by Mr. Jaans. In the years to come those who lend ECU in the medium and longer term must know that they will be repaid in real money. That is why there was this sentence on page 2 of the Rapporteurs' little note. I think that this is an important point. We cannot say that we are going to do away with all obstacles in the path of the use of the ECU if we do not also have a sentence which will reassure people about assets denominated in ECU. Secondly, one can take all due precautions but if there is not a political and psychological impetus behind the ECU, as Governor Duisenberg said, we would sentence the ECU to disappearing without having wanted to do this. The third point is still pending. This single currency, even if it were to be called the ECU, nowhere do we say that it is going to be a basket and like President Pöhl I don't think that it is going to be a basket. It will be a sui generis currency, but we will have to combine these three elements in a sentence which will be acceptable to all. We say ""no"" to those who tell us, or who will tell us, you did not make the fullest possible use of the ECU in order to help towards economic and monetary union. We will say ""no"" and we will explain why. On the other hand, we don't want to be reproached with having implicitly sentenced to death the ECU. I would like to remind you of the fact that the other day, corporation managers met not in order to celebrate the ECU as a symbol they just explained concretely what costs they incurred because there was no single currency, and whilst waiting for the single currency what are they using more and more? The ECU. Therefore, one has to find a form of words which will allow the ECU to go on living and growing without taking up a final position as to what the definition of the single currency will be. The Rapporteurs will try and find the sentence which will contain these three key elements. This also has a psychological impact, monetary matters always have a psychological aspect.

Paragraph 5. I think that there is a contradiction between paragraph 5 and paragraph 1. In paragraph 1 we say lots of things: standards of living, external balance, etc. and here we find the three conditions that have to be fulfilled for the union. Far too brutal I think, far too hard and dry and I think Governor Ciampi is right, these are necessary conditions but they are not sufficient, there must be other conditions as well. Therefore, a little more consistency between paragraphs 1 and 5.

Secondly, at the bottom of page 3 I think we do not have a good enough explanation of why it would be better to have a single currency. That of course is what Mr. Boyer has just raised. One shouldn't perhaps have the same argument all over the place, but we want to be certain that somewhere one would explain quite clearly the advantage of having a single currency rather than several national currencies: irreversibility, the weight carried by a single currency on foreign markets.

Another point, paragraph 6, third line. I would add ""in principle"" not strictly necessary.

I do not like the sentence in brackets at the top of page 5. (That is going to be deleted, this was said this morning. Everything which contains the means of the implementation of this policy will be referred to the annex.) I think that this is ... a whole process of integration. I think it is also more complicated than would appear here.

Page 6, two-thirds down the paragraph we read ""balance-of-payments figures which are currently a highly visible and sensitive indicator … would no longer be able to play"" I would say ""such a significant role"" because they may still play a certain role, they won't disappear.

Page 7, fifth line: “implies a fundamental change in the economic"" and I would add ""as well as the monetary management of the Community"". Those were my modest contributions.","My contribution for the Rapporteurs:

Boyer,Miguel Boyer,1954 - 1986,1954,1986,32,,,,EN,"I think it is going to be very difficult to go further than the definition we have on page 7 of an economic union. In abstract terms this is almost perfect: economic union means liberalisation of markets and a minimum degree of intervention in order to supply public service. Here we have the principle of subsidiarity again, the level of public goods which each one feels he has to offer is limited as far as the Community is concerned, the decision is left to each one for his own country. I think that this is the most perfect definition imaginable here. Then of course you have to draw the appropriate consequences from this definition. Why is economic union more difficult to define? Because for money the basic idea is that money should become as neutral as possible, money is no longer an instrument which will be used in order to accelerate the growth in one country or another, no, one is going to try and have money which will be as neutral as possible. But for tax systems, costs, macro-economic matters, one cannot say that one wishes to be neutral because government intervention is never neutral and nobody has ever alleged that taxation policy was neutral, and since it is not going to be neutral there will be different political stances and if one wants to harmonise everything nobody is going to agree. Then, and this is perhaps the most substantial remark I have to make, a sentence which looks quite innocent on page 9, paragraph 13 ""Tax treatment must not discriminate in favour or against economic activities across the Community countries"" is quite unacceptable. What does it mean? Does it mean that corporate taxes or income tax should be the same everywhere? Because any taxation system implies discrimination in favour of certain regions or certain activities, this is one of the basic principles of taxation policy. If one wants to push economic union to the point where there is no taxation discrimination between countries, one is going to give up an element which helps to combat disequilibria and, as the Unions sometimes say, social security should be the same everywhere. (The Chairman: yes, a general levelling up.) If one harmonises taxes and social security systems one would be discriminating the least favoured countries of the Community. You cannot push harmonisation that far otherwise convergence and the difficulties in adjustment will be even greater. Therefore, one must accept the principle that economic union is not total harmonisation, certainly not tax and cost harmonisation, until the economic situation and the incomes in all Community countries will be the same. Therefore, here again the principle of subsidiarity applies unless you can demonstrate the contrary.","I think it is going to be very difficult to go further than the definition we have on page 7 of an economic union.

6,2/14/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",623,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,2044 - 2081,2044,2081,37,,,,EN,"I suggest that economic union be defined in terms of rules, like monetary union: total freedom of movement for persons, capital, resources and then certain functions which will be supplied at Community level by means of such things as the law on competition, concentrations, monopolies, taxation, the resources which are absorbed for the Community policies and expenditure. Economic union would rest on four main pillars: the rules of competition which prevent one country from exaggeratedly subsidising its economic activities. There are rules governing competition, we have had them for a long time and they are becoming more and more effective as has become apparent during the last four years. Then an environment which will ensure that the market which will operate as well as possible. We have quite a lot of texts on concentrations, take-over bids. Then a Community policy which would concentrate on co-operation and regional development. Fourthly, close co-operation between budget policy with a greater or lesser degree of constraint imposed.

These I think are the four pillars on which economic union rests. Part I we can, of course, talk about what will happen to the wages, etc. but at least if we want to be simple these are the four basic pillars. By virtue of the principle of subsidiarity we cannot do everything. In 1992 the Community budget will amount to 1.2% of gross GDP of member countries, perhaps at the end of the century we shall have 3% public expenditure. In other words, economic union will be less spectacular than monetary union for reasons of common sense. I think that these four pillars are very important and if they are all used effectively, they will enable each country to live with its differences and they will continue to benefit from a sufficient margin for manoeuvre as far as their domestic policies are concerned. In view of the present stage of development of the Community, to try to go beyond that would not be reasonable it seems to me. Through the rules on competition, one is identifying better and better those subsidies and aids which distort the rules of competition, and there are very strict rules in the Treaty of Rome. I am not at all saying that the way I have proposed this is the ideal, but I think that these are the four basic principles. (de Larosière: This is going to help us because just having these two criteria is not terribly helpful.)

If you agree we could have ten lines about competition policy, then ten lines in which to describe the environment for the single market, and then today we would have to try to see what the binding rules would be governing fiscal policy, budgetary policy, and then how to ensure that the regions would benefit from the advantages of this union. I think this would make it easier for the heads of government to understand this. They would find signposts couched in a language that they can understand.","I suggest that economic union be defined in terms of rules, like monetary union: total freedom of movement for persons, capital, resources and then certain functions which will be supplied at Community level by means of such things as the law on competition, concentrations, monopolies, taxation, the resources which are absorbed for the Community policies and expenditure. Economic union would rest on four main pillars: the rules of competition which prevent one country from exaggeratedly subsidising its economic activities. There are rules governing competition, we have had them for a long time and they are becoming more and more effective as has become apparent during the last four years. Then an environment which will ensure that the market which will operate as well as possible. We have quite a lot of texts on concentrations, take-over bids. Then a Community policy which would concentrate on co-operation and regional development. Fourthly, close co-operation between budget policy with a greater or lesser degree of constraint imposed.

These I think are the four pillars on which economic union rests. Part I we can, of course, talk about what will happen to the wages, etc. but at least if we want to be simple these are the four basic pillars. By virtue of the principle of subsidiarity we cannot do everything. In 1992 the Community budget will amount to 1.2% of gross GDP of member countries, perhaps at the end of the century we shall have 3% public expenditure. In other words, economic union will be less spectacular than monetary union for reasons of common sense. I think that these four pillars are very important and if they are all used effectively, they will enable each country to live with its differences and they will continue to benefit from a sufficient margin for manoeuvre as far as their domestic policies are concerned. In view of the present stage of development of the Community, to try to go beyond that would not be reasonable it seems to me. Through the rules on competition, one is identifying better and better those subsidies and aids which distort the rules of competition, and there are very strict rules in the Treaty of Rome. I am not at all saying that the way I have proposed this is the ideal, but I think that these are the four basic principles.

The question is then whether all regions of the Community will benefit from this new Europe arose in connection with 1992 and the single market, it arises even more in connection with economic and monetary union. Firstly, I should like to say in order to ensure that the discussion will be clear that one has to make due allowance for the specific characteristics of Ireland. It is quite unbearable for that country to bear the cost of training its young people and then see them wander off and generate added value elsewhere. If one looks at what has been happening in the Community over the past five years, doubtless it is Ireland that has borne the heaviest cost, but between the single European space and economic and monetary union, what instrument are you going to lose? Only one: adjustment through exchange rates and you haven't used that much for all sorts of reasons. Therefore, I think that the question that arises is similar to the problem that arises in connection with the instituting of a single market, but it becomes even more urgent.

It seems to me that the regional policies of the 1990s will be a combination of a better utilisation of the human and natural resources of each region and appropriate policies implemented from the centre in favour of the least favoured regions. If there have been so many papers on regional policy it is because I wished that those of you who are particularly interested in this to read the opinions of those who have been working in this area for several years. Firstly, one has to be fair towards what has already been done and the package which had already been approved by the European Council in February 1988 of which there are two main components. Firstly, a doubling of the resources, the financial resources allocated to structural policies; and, secondly, the replacement of the project approach by a programme-based approach. But I agree with you that were I the sole author of the Report I would refer to this - I wouldn't call it perhaps an important step, but a step. I would say that we have to show proof that the policies work and if in 1991/92 these policies have proved ineffective then I think that the construction of Europe will grind to a halt because certain countries will refuse to go on. They may have no alternative solution but they may just find that the burden has become too heavy for them. Our perspective has changed since February 1988. Remember that until then the Commission handled 16,000 projects per annuum. What kind of intellectual control do you think they could have? From now on they will be grappling with sixty or seventy programmes which will run for several years, drawn up in partnership with each region. I have fought for Ireland to be accepted as a region and our Italian friends did not enjoy that at all, they haven't been completely converted yet. I think that these policies must be put to the test and am quite in favour of saying this quite strongly in the Report. In 1992 there will be a challenge if Portugal, the least favoured regions of Spain, Italy and Ireland have not been able to benefit from these policies, either because of their own fault or for reasons of an imperfect basic concept then everything will grind to a halt. I am in favour of saying this. On the other hand, if these policies will have proved successful they will have to be added to, they will have to be expanded, to be quite brutal. Economic and monetary union won't be possible with ECU 14 billion in the structural budget alone. I did say that the budget will have to grow and we will have to say this in so many words to ensure that the leaders of the most prosperous countries know what is in store for them.

This being said there are only two matters that remain pending - they are very difficult though. Firstly, do I not have illusions about the ability for some regions to develop thanks to their own efforts? I think that the development that occurred in the 1960s has come to an end. In the 1960s we had a rate of economic growth of 5 or 6% and there was therefore quite a lot left over which could be transferred. This has become very much more difficult with a rate of growth of 3%, particularly in view of the change in the economy where the service sector has become very much more important than the secondary sector. If we look at the American experience, it is certain regions making use of their own resources, with help from outside, which has enabled them to make progress. This is something that can be discussed, but for the time being this concept for emphasising self-development and making use of the special possibilities of a region is something very interesting. I will make an exception for Ireland, which after all is not only a region but also a country with a capital, etc. and that is why I warmly defended the Irish case at the Council because I felt that one can have a failure in the Algarve in Portugal without endangering membership of Portugal and endangering the benefits that can derive from this European construction. One cannot allow Ireland as a nation to run a similar risk. There is a special Irish problem, therefore.

First question: will our regions find possibilities for their self-development? The second question is that posed by Mr. Boyer: in the light of a monetary and economic union which will bring more growth, would there not be companies which will be attracted towards regions where the costs of production are lower? We have talked this over at great length, have quite a lot of experience and from time to time I had to fight with the Commissioner in charge of competition - he was quite a hard man, I used to call him the Sheriff! I saw companies that decided to establish themselves in regions where the costs were expensive because the infrastructure was there. For instance, a Dutch company chose to establish itself in Hamburg rather than Schleswig-Holstein, and then others again went where the costs of production were lowest, where life was pleasant. So you see in both cases there were attractions. This is why I would like us to have a text which would reflect your concerns, which I share, but which also contained these other elements. The main element it seems to me is the one which you have referred to, and though one has to be very frank towards governments, all the more so that it was very difficult for the structural fund to be doubled. The richer countries must be aware of the fact that there will be no economic and monetary union if the budget for structural policies continues to be ECU 14 billion. It won't be possible. Not only must we demonstrate that the new approach is sound, but that if it is sound it must be pursued and that one makes more allowance for the regional dimension when one engages in common policies in respect of the environment, research and employment.

I think one would need a chapter which should not be too affirmative but couched in fairly careful terms. I am not speaking for you, but for me. I would not wish that in five or six years from now I am suddenly confronted with statements that I have made today and which have been put to nothing by reality. For instance, there are places in Portugal and Greece which are distinctly underdeveloped. There are no transport infrastructures, no telecommunications, no education and training. There are other regions where the infrastructure is there and yet there is no economic activity, which explains that a regional development policy must be far more carefully tailored to local conditions. It is this kind of thinking, together with yours, that I would like to have in a chapter in this Report, while indicating also that there is perhaps also a definite political risk. After all we do not really know what really makes for economic growth. Japan and the USA have been growing for the past seven years, Europe has joined them only two or three years ago. When I put questions to the economists, they tell me that the real cause for this growth is scientific and technological progress. If this is so, and if the only thing that could put a stop to this growth is mistakes in respect of economic policies, then one will have to take this into account, one will have to transfer technological know-how and research centres to these regions so that as a result of a synergetic effect they might benefit from the advantages resulting from scientific and technological progress, plus the macro-economic conditions in each country. Would you agree to this kind of presentation? A combination of your paper and my ideas, and I urge that we couch all of this in careful and prudent terms, because also we don't want our governments to be dragged into a decision which they have perhaps not clearly considered.","I really think that we needed this statement.

Two remarks, Mr. Chairman, one on the mandate and functions. As Jacques said it was my proposal because I just wanted to make the whole thing a little more operational. Having said that I think we have to say something about price stability, it has to be here in this context as the main objective of monetary policy. My suggestion would be the following, that we try to merge the two proposals and then it would read - but I leave it to our Rapporteurs to improve:

We delete the first indent and start with the second: ""the System will be responsible for the formulation of monetary policy at the Community level, ..."". That I think is very important, that it is a Community decision-making process, that is what we are really aiming for. ""... for the co-ordination of policy implementation at the regional level and for the maintenance of a properly functioning payments system. It should be committed (the System) to regulate the amount of money in circulation and credit supplied by banks and other financial institutions on the basis of criteria designed to ensure price stability, as well as economic growth"".

The next indent, I wonder whether we should delete the two square brackets and ""the System will be responsible for the formulation of banking supervisory policy"". In my country that would be considered as a provocation if I would subscribe to a Report in which that would be suggested, but I have no objections, on the contrary I would like to provoke those who have asked me to participate here.

I have to come back to the status which I think is a very important question and we should really not just go over it and say it is not our job to say something. I think it is a very important point, at least to me, that we make it clear that in our view efficient monetary policy in Europe is not conceivable without a central bank system which has a certain degree of independence. That we should emphasise and make even a little clearer than it has been here. The word ""a proper democratic legitimisation"" I would not use, because the democratic legitimisation I think would be the fact that the governments would decide to set up such an institution, that there would be a Treaty which would be ratified by parliaments and if that is done that is enough democratic legitimisation for such an institution. They don't have to have legitimisation every week by reporting to somebody - that is not necessary. Legitimisation is in the Treaty in my view.

The question of who should appoint the Governors and the Chairman is of course of crucial importance and the question is, of course, whether we should make proposals, so maybe it would be a solution if we would just say: ""this is a very crucial question and this has to be decided in the spirit of maintaining the independence of that institution"". One could go one step further and say if one wants to, and if it is necessary, to have an independent institution that the appointment should be formalised and should be for rather long periods of time, etc. - this kind of criteria. Also that maybe the institution itself should have a kind of veto right as it is in the USA for instance, where the Board of Governors has a veto right as far as the appointment of Presidents of Federal Reserve banks is concerned. That is something I would very much like to have in Germany, I don't have that unfortunately, it is the great weakness in our system that I don't have this veto right. It means, in fact, that the provincial governments can appoint whom they want. I think we have to think about this process of appointment and how that should be done. We should think about that in more detail and pick up that point in our next meeting. Really it is worth having second thoughts about that. The annual report, etc. I think is a minor problem.","

Jaans,Pierre Jaans,872 - 908,872,908,36,,,,EN,"I have some hope that between the positions expressed by Governor Leigh-Pemberton and by Governor de Larosière there is not a real and fundamental contradiction. I think if we tell the Heads of State in our Report that if and when they embark on the process of EMU, it is not just embarking on stage one and not on stage two, it is a whole process with three stages, and if they decide to go in that direction an early decision also has to be taken in order to revise the Treaty. I think if one is clear about the prerogative of the Heads of State to start the whole process, which should be just one process - it is not improving structures in the EMS that is a different thing, that has been done in Basle/Nyborg and that can be done also on the basis of Basle/Nyborg. If they decide to go in that direction then, of course, it is necessary also to have the Treaty revision and to have it during stage one. I think that is in my view a more apparent contradiction between the two positions expressed.

Two other points which I think are eminently political and where this Committee probably has not, let's say, the best expertise, or is not entitled to have the best expertise. One is the question of whether there should be one or more Treaty changes. We can‘t indicate that this thing can be done in one or more Treaty changes, but I think we should not, as is done at present, indicate a preference so to say for one Treaty change enabling provisions, etc., because the whole process is likely to last over more than one legislature and personally I would hesitate to take the right, so to say, to deprive a second legislature from the possibility to look at that and to foreclose anything by just one act where the Parliament afterwards would be completely bound. That is one point which I think is a point which has to be left to the politicians. We should indicate that there are two ways but probably we should not express a preference.

A third element, also in my view eminently political, is the question of whether one can start EMU with not all members in it so to say, if one can start it outside the Treaty, if one can embark in the direction of a two-speed way to work. There may be a lot of arguments to do that, but I think the point is so political it touches to the very heart of the Treaty and the whole philosophy of the Community that we, in my view, should just raise it, point to the fact that it is an eminently political choice, but the choice has to be left to the Heads of State.","I have some hope that between the positions expressed by Governor Leigh-Pemberton and by Governor de Larosière there is not a real and fundamental contradiction.

7,3/14/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",739,M. A. Lamfalussy,Alexandre Lamfalussy,911 - 974,911,974,63,,,,EN,"I think that Robin really raises a very substantial question and I was trying to make up my own mind on that question by reading the description of the first stage as if I had never heard about it; I was trying to make a reading as an outside reader, reading the Report for the first time. I think if you make the same effort you come to the conclusion that the only major substantive recommendation in that first stage today is to suggest that the Committee of Governors change their method of work and shift towards ex ante policy recommendations, which are not binding, of course, but which are explicit recommendations. That is a major shift and that is a major proposal, all the rest is interesting, but when you say the same thing about fiscal policies and budgetary policies you know perfectly well that there is no budgetary committee comparable to the Governors and with independent sovereign states that doesn't mean much. I am putting these things very bluntly, but that is how any reader would feel about it. I think this recommendation about the work of the Committee of Governors is a very serious one, a very important one, and I would certainly regard it as being a very important first step, and be happy with it as long as it can be regarded as being credible. There is nothing in the present status of the Governors that would prevent them, or would have prevented them, for the last twenty years, of doing it already and any reader of this Report would really come up with this first conclusion.

From there I jump to the second point of my reasoning which is to say that, in order to make the first step credible, there ought to be a clear political signal, and I use the word in that sense, signal or commitment which makes it clear that this first step is the beginning of a process - that is the point which was made by M. Jaans in a different way. We need a signal because otherwise nobody will take this recommendation seriously to be quite blunt. What is the political signal that you can expect? There, of course, you may have nuanced views. Clearly the most obvious political signal would be for the Heads of State and governments to say we decide to go ahead, and in order to show that we really mean business, we give instructions to our Ministers to start discussions on the Treaty. That is an unequivocal political signal, we don't have to say that we recommend you to do that - no, we don't recommend it we simply say that to the extent that you want to go ahead and that you want the Governors to go ahead with the first step, please give a political signal and a political signal is, of course, a Treaty negotiation.

One can imagine other signals as well and I am not absolutely dogmatic about this point, what I am dogmatic about is that we need a political signal because otherwise the whole thing falls absolutely flat and will become totally incredible. What other signals could there be? Of course, a new Directive, beefing up the 1964 Directive could be done, but when you look at the Directive it is difficult to beef it up, it was there already in 1964, so what sort of credibility would you gain by adding to that? Then there is, of course, a third political signal which is not as constitutional as the Treaty negotiation but which is a very practical one. I will just mention it, and that is if the UK announced joining the EMS. That is the biggest, most practical political signal that could be made. I would stop here by saying that what I am very insistent on, and I am rarely dogmatic, is the absolute need for a political commitment of some kind. What sort of political commitment? I am ready to ponder that, but the need for political commitment, to my mind, is absolutely essential. In the present formulation of the first stage, and that is where I join forces with Jacques de Larosière, if the first stage was drafted in a different way, then that in itself could make a political commitment.

7,3/14/1989,OK,,T,750,Herrn K.-O. Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,1287 - 1370,1287,1370,83,,,,EN,"I fully agree with what has been said by Governor de Larosière and M. Lamfalussy on the desirability of a political signal to Europe. I think that would be at least desirable, whether it is necessary or not is a different question, but politically it may be desirable to give a signal that the European Governments are prepared to move in the direction of a monetary union and that they emphasise that by concrete decisions. We cannot give this signal, it is not our task and we are not authorised to give any signals, we can only make some proposals, but we cannot or should not make proposals only to make proposals, proposals for schemes which are not useful or not desirable or not necessary. Therefore I am not prepared to associate myself; we have a functioning system, we are fully participating in the system and, for instance, Jacques I am sorry but I really don't think that a Reserve Fund is necessary or useful or has … Only to make a proposal and only to give this a little more substance, only for that reason to go so far and to propose things like that I think is not useful. I agree that if we only say, well we want you to implement the convergence Directive from 1977, there have been dozens of these resolutions in the past, if you go into this and study that our Committee was set up in 1964 and I read the resolution and you are absolutely right there is everything in it. And we have a statute - I didn't even know that we have a statute - which already says that we can make recommendations, it is nothing new what we are proposing so I fully share your concerns, there is nothing really spectacular and nobody will be excited if we say, well, we will co-operate even more closely in the future and we will make some proposals with a qualified majority, whatever that means because all are equal but some are a little more equal, etc.

Who can give the political signal? The politicians, the governments. What can be the political signal? Of course, they could say that we decided today that we will start to negotiate a Treaty for EMU, but I will not propose that because I think we fool ourselves. Firstly, we all know that several governments in Europe are not prepared to start such negotiations at this stage, that is for sure, neither the British Government and I think also the German Government. The German Government has said in its Annual Report they have made a warning against premature institutional changes, so I don't think they will accept that. So two governments at least, I don't know about Denmark, Holland, other countries, I don't know about France, I don't know whether governments in Europe are really prepared at this stage to negotiate a Treaty which would imply far-reaching transfers of sovereignty rights, that is what we will have to say. If you do that you will have to be aware that that means that you give up far-reaching, very relevant sovereignty rights - are you really prepared to do that? Only as a question can we raise that, but we cannot propose that - I wouldn't propose it at least.

So what could be the other signal? As long as almost half of the membership of the EEC is either not able or not willing to fulfil the rules - which are already there - the EMS is there and it is clearly defined and it works - as long as five countries, if I am not mistaken, are either not able (in some cases) or not willing (in the case of Britain or in the case of Italy, which is also unfortunately after 10 years only half a member - and it seems to me, if I may say so as a footnote, a little bizarre that the Prime Ministers of Spain and Italy, I read, are the ones who ask for monetary union. Two countries which are obviously not in a position to fulfil the given rules.) As long as that is the case I don't think it makes much sense to negotiate a Treaty. I fully agree with the procedure which has been suggested - I have to examine the text as it is a very far-reaching proposal which you make with this intergovernmental conference, but I think we should say, firstly, we have to in the first stage really complete the EMS, step-by-step. I understand that Greece or Portugal cannot join the EMS in the near future and shouldn't become hostages. Maybe we will come to the conclusion that a smaller country can have a special relationship, but two major countries - Britain and Italy - should fulfil the rules before we talk about a Treaty. The Treaty has to be approved by all European governments, including those who are not members of the EMS or the ERM so far. We have to make it clear to the public and to the governments that they have to give the signal and not we, we cannot give a signal we can only tell them what the signal should be. The signal in my view is at this stage not that we start to negotiate a Treaty. In the light of our discussions here I think that is very unrealistic to make such a proposal and I think other governors share this view and I think we have to find out ... (M. de Larosière: I think we have to count ourselves, you cannot speak for everybody. I could accept the proposal that we embark on a Treaty, I could accept that). I am not speaking for everyone, I am speaking for myself, so I am asking the Chairman to find out who is of this opinion and who is of a different opinion and maybe we can say in our Report, some governors are of the opinion that we should start immediately to negotiate a Treaty, but other governors ... But we have to find out, and I want to find out who is in favour of a Reserve Fund. I am not, but I don't know about the others. We can say that in our Report, why shouldn't we have different views on these matters? I think that is normal. (M. de Larosière: On the Reserve Fund, if I may say, the views are perfectly expressed, but the criticisms have been so negative that I would have to put some more positive things in my own proposal, because now it has become very unbalanced, so you cannot say that these oppositions have not been stated, they have been stated.) I want to know who is supporting your proposal, which members here in this room are supporting this proposal in order to see whether it is the majority or minority, but this is not the right criteria. We have to be clear who is supporting which proposal. I think we have made some progress because it has become clear now where we stand and what we are aiming for.","I fully agree with what has been said by Governor de Larosière and M.

We can say that in our Report, why shouldn't we have different views on these matters? I think that is normal. (M. de Larosière: On the Reserve Fund, if I may say, the views are perfectly expressed, but the criticisms have been so negative that I would have to put some more positive things in my own proposal, because now it has become very unbalanced, so you cannot say that these oppositions have not been stated, they have been stated.) I want to know who is supporting your proposal, which members here in this room are supporting this proposal in order to see whether it is the majority or minority, but this is not the right criteria. We have to be clear who is supporting which proposal. I think we have made some progress because it has become clear now where we stand and what we are aiming for."

7,3/14/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",756,The Chairman,Jaques Delors,1486 - 1537,1486,1537,51,,,,EN,"I would like to submit to the Committee a few ideas by way of guidelines because we have made progress as compared to the first compromise which we had arrived at. Before drawing conclusions, may I remind you of the fact that you are not mere central bank governors but you are personal representatives of your governments and it is in the light of this that your performance will be measured. I attended the dinner of the European Council and all the Heads of government said we appoint a personal representative to this Committee and they all said, our Governor. You are therefore the personal representatives of your governments and I am very sorry to have to remind you of this but this is probably the only thing of which I am quite convinced and certain, for everything else I am prepared to change the Report or to amend it, but on this point I have no doubts at all, it is the only one.

What do we gather from this discussion? Firstly, that we have to indicate more clearly that there will be a transfer of sovereignty and this must be said more clearly and more fully, I think there is no doubt about that at all. We have learnt our lesson. The working paper is a bit confused on this, the Rapporteurs themselves admit that it is repetitious, all of this can be corrected. The first point that I want to submit to you for confirmation is this: the transfer of sovereignty implied. Secondly, one has to recall with more forcefulness what I have always said that the objective of EMU is price stability, perhaps, one ought to put this point across more forcefully. Surely this was said at the beginning of our discussions and then it got lost along the way somewhere. Some perhaps felt that in a very lengthy Report the weighting was perhaps not appropriate. Thirdly, the Treaty. Nobody doubts that a Treaty will be needed, nobody contests this. The problem is when and how are we going to refer to it. Perhaps, one might have a unanimous view starting from what Mr. Jaans said. He said by embarking on phase one you embark on a process and this process will one day require the Treaty to be amended, a contrario. This means that if you don't want a Treaty then abstain from embarking on phase one, don't get into the process. You can think about this over lunch and perhaps we could reach agreement on that. Then we would reorganise the paper to take into account President Pöhl's criticisms and once we have put that into Parts II or III we would then look at Governor Duisenberg's text. One ought to make sure that the Heads of State read this properly, but there is an important point. At the beginning you said when we have handed over our report then others will have to continue our work. What Governor Duisenberg said to me yesterday was that if the Heads of State were to take this Report into consideration, they are certainly going to ask the Monetary Committee, the Committee of Governors, perhaps the Ministers of Finance to do some additional work and this work will be tantamount to a preparatory phase for an intergovernmental conference. Of course, we don't decide when that will take place but preparatory work will be required. There are institutionalists, then there are economic experts, legal experts, etc. and this is what we read in paragraph 75. Think about this too whether you can agree on this.

As for participation, membership, there is disagreement. It is not very nice to have to say something in so many words when one is the President, it might be misinterpreted. Anyway if you say that one will be able to go in for EMU only if everybody is part of the EMS then you are taking up a political position and not only a technical position.","I would like to submit to the Committee a few ideas by way of guidelines because we have made progress as compared to the first compromise which we had arrived at.

That is a misinterpretation of what I have said. I have said that the most important single step towards an EMU is that all member states of the EEC are creating the preconditions for participating in the existing institutions. (The Chairman: What does ""preconditions"" mean?) They have to reduce their budget deficit, they have to bring their inflation rates down, they have to be willing to participate in the case of Britain, in the case of Italy they have to pursue policies. That is the most important step towards an EMU because by definition the fixing of exchange rates is one of the two main elements of a monetary union. That is what I was going to say. I have not said that we will not negotiate anything before everybody agrees and talk about every state as a member of that, that is an unfair interpretation. (The Chairman: That is not unfair, on the contrary I want to be fair, because you say ""the preconditions are full participation, full liberalisation of capital flows and the objective: price stability, budgetary discipline"".) But those are the three main steps towards EMU. They are not institutional changes because we have the institutions. It is wrong what Mariano has said, it is not correct. He is saying you are against all institutional changes. We have the institutions, we have the convergence Directive, we have this statute of our Committee, and all member countries are participating in our elaborations, even those countries which are not members of the ERM are participating in the realignment discussions, for instance, so we don't need new institutions and we shouldn't give the impression that creating new institutions and new Resolutions (of which we have dozens) would solve our problems. We have to point our finger - and that is our responsibility and I will do that - on the substance of the problems. The substance is that we have to aim for convergence in Europe, we have made some progress in that direction; the substance is that we create the environment for stable exchange rates, not by declarations or funds but by the right policies; and that we introduce full liberalisation of capital movements, where we have made some progress. But this is not a concession to abolish capital restrictions, exchange controls, this has already been said in the Treaty of Rome.

This is really a question substance and I know that we disagree on that point, but I really want you to change the whole chapter on the ECU, which is not reflecting at least my views and maybe the views of others, it goes much too far and has not been discussed here with this content I think. My proposal would be to drop paragraph 37 from the first line until  paragraph 55, but that may go a little too far, so I have a compromise proposal:

""The Committee examined various aspects of the role that the ECU could be expected to play in the process of economic and monetary integration in Europe. Firstly, the Committee was of the opinion that the monetary union does not necessarily require a single currency. However, political and psychological reasons suggest that a single currency would be a desirable feature of a monetary union. A declaration that the ECU, properly defined (not the basket ECU), should assume the role of the future single currency of the Community could be made at the outset, in order to ensure private agents that there would be no discontinuity between the present ECU and the single currency of the union, and that ECU obligations would be payable at face value in ECU if the transition to the single currency had been made at the time of the maturity of the contract. But it was also felt that such a declaration might better be left for a time considerably closer to the birth of the common currency.""

And then we have paragraph 55. Secondly, the Committee considers the possibility of adopting a parallel currency ...'' And that we drop completely paragraphs 56 and 57 because we can say, if you want, that we should abolish all the administrative barriers for the use of the private ECU - that is something we have agreed - but that would only be one sentence. I am not prepared to support the idea that the private use of the ECU should be encouraged because my own view is that the private ECU will lose importance more and more and we have to say at the beginning, in my view, that the ECU has not come up to expectation. The assessment of the ECU at the beginning in the first chapter is much too positive and absolutely incorrect if you take into account, for instance, what Lamfalussy's report said on the use of the ECU. I think the private ECU was attractive only at the time when we had capital controls and exchange controls and the private ECU has had only some attractiveness in countries with capital controls and exchange controls - in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark the ECU was never attractive for private users. We have abolished all barriers for the ECU and it is absolutely without any relevance, significance in Germany. Nobody holds an ECU account - some people do - but ECU bonds are not attractive and businesses are not really interested in that and so we give the ECU much too much relevance here in this chapter and it is really not the case, in fact. I have nothing against the ECU, it is an instrument it is not a currency. There are so many words here which I think are absolutely wrong. The ECU is not a currency, it is a basket of currencies, but here it is said that it should be granted the status of a foreign currency, we have always said that that is not our understanding of the ECU. It is a question of definition and it has no monetary policy relevance. The use of the official ECU is practically zero, no central bank in Europe holds significant amounts of ECU voluntarily, except the ones we get for our swaps, because all the settlements are done in DM or in dollars and maybe other currencies as well. We have this clearance system and it works, we can say OK well it has some relevance, but it is not correct to say that it has become an important currency, etc. We have to change the whole chapter, maybe our Rapporteurs can change it. I am not prepared to accept the proposal made by Mr. Thygesen on the monetary use, we can put that in the Annex, but not under the headline of the Committee, only under the headline of Mr. Thygesen. In that case I would suggest that all papers which have been presented to this Committee should be published in an Annex, including for instance the papers I have submitted to the Committee and others have: Jacques de Larosière's paper, if he wants. (M. de Larosière: I would be delighted!) But all under our own signature. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, but this is a point of substance and I cannot accept that, it gives a completely wrong view. Our views are very known, for years we have made them public, they are all described in my papers and I really wonder how this could be written here because it is known - or should be at least - that this is not acceptable to me.","I have much more radical proposals to make on this chapter on the ECU so maybe I can do it in context.

But it was also felt that such a declaration might better be left for a time considerably closer to the birth of the common currency.""

And then we have paragraph 55. Secondly, the Committee considers the possibility of adopting a parallel currency ...'' And that we drop completely paragraphs 56 and 57 because we can say, if you want, that we should abolish all the administrative barriers for the use of the private ECU - that is something we have agreed - but that would only be one sentence. I am not prepared to support the idea that the private use of the ECU should be encouraged because my own view is that the private ECU will lose importance more and more and we have to say at the beginning, in my view, that the ECU has not come up to expectation. The assessment of the ECU at the beginning in the first chapter is much too positive and absolutely incorrect if you take into account, for instance, what Lamfalussy's report said on the use of the ECU. I think the private ECU was attractive only at the time when we had capital controls and exchange controls and the private ECU has had only some attractiveness in countries with capital controls and exchange controls - in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark the ECU was never attractive for private users. We have abolished all barriers for the ECU and it is absolutely without any relevance, significance in Germany. Nobody holds an ECU account - some people do - but ECU bonds are not attractive and businesses are not really interested in that and so we give the ECU much too much relevance here in this chapter and it is really not the case, in fact. I have nothing against the ECU, it is an instrument it is not a currency. There are so many words here which I think are absolutely wrong. The ECU is not a currency, it is a basket of currencies, but here it is said that it should be granted the status of a foreign currency, we have always said that that is not our understanding of the ECU. It is a question of definition and it has no monetary policy relevance. The use of the official ECU is practically zero, no central bank in Europe holds significant amounts of ECU voluntarily, except the ones we get for our swaps, because all the settlements are done in DM or in dollars and maybe other currencies as well. We have this clearance system and it works, we can say OK well it has some relevance, but it is not correct to say that it has become an important currency, etc. We have to change the whole chapter, maybe our Rapporteurs can change it. I am not prepared to accept the proposal made by Mr. Thygesen on the monetary use, we can put that in the Annex, but not under the headline of the Committee, only under the headline of Mr. Thygesen. In that case I would suggest that all papers which have been presented to this Committee should be published in an Annex, including for instance the papers I have submitted to the Committee and others have: Jacques de Larosière's paper, if he wants. (M. de Larosière: I would be delighted!) But all under our own signature. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, but this is a point of substance and I cannot accept that, it gives a completely wrong view. Our views are very known, for years we have made them public, they are all described in my papers and I really wonder how this could be written here because it is known - or should be at least - that this is not acceptable to me."

Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,768 - 853,768,853,85,,,,EN,"I think we have clear disagreement on this point, but this is nothing new, we know about this for ten years because we discussed this already eleven years ago when we set up the EMS. That was one of the main points of disagreement from the beginning because we always had strong reservations against the encouragement of the use of the ECU for many many reasons, because it is developing into something of which we are losing control. We have national currencies which are controlled by national central banks, but there is something developing which we cannot control and then we approach a stage where we are asked to act as lender-of-last-resort as central banks. This is a very substantial, serious concern, maybe it is exaggerated but this was always the German position on that. It is not only a question of goodwill, so to say. I am not saying that we should be too negative, I am not against the private use of the ECU. We should leave it to the markets, as you have suggested, and we should say that we should not discriminate the ECU, but we should not discriminate national currencies either. That I think we should say. This is the case in some countries where other European currencies are discriminated against the ECU, that is also not really consistent with our aims. I have made a proposal to replace paragraph 54, which I have read. It is a little less enthusiastic, I think that should be acceptable. Paragraph 55 could stand as it is.

Paragraph 56, maybe we could say: ""Thirdly, the Committee examined proposals for the use of the official ECU in the context of a common monetary policy. The Committee could not examine all the details of these proposals which are published in an Annex."" We have to make it clear that we have not agreed on that.

Then we say paragraph 57: ""Fourthly, the Committee agreed that the voluntary use of the ECU by the private sector should not be discriminated, existing barriers should be abolished.""

What I don't want to say is that we want to encourage both the official use or the private use, because that has far-reaching implications. For instance, the official ECU: if we encourage the use of the official ECU what does it mean? Do we really want to encourage the European governments to borrow in ECUs? Do we want to encourage the German Government to borrow in lira and French franc and pesetas? It is too expensive and really makes no sense at all. The official ECU only plays a role if there are disturbances in the exchange markets, because it only plays a role if there are interventions. If there are no interventions, the official ECU fortunately plays no role - fortunately.

The private ECU: it is a market instrument and if people want it, it's OK, but why should we encourage it? Why should people be encouraged to use the private ECU instead of national currencies? I can see no reason and it has no relevance for monetary union.

If we say there should be no discrimination, it should be left to the markets, that I think would be fine with me. What I am against is this ""strong encouragement"" - that is language which we are used to from the EEC and others, but which I would not support.

(Ciampi: Could Pöhl re-read his proposal for paragraph 54 again.)

Pöhl re-reads proposal.

(Ciampi: Would it be possible to say it the other way round?)

Yes, that's fine with me, you would say it would be desirable to have ... But that hasn't been said in the original text. But we have to say somewhere that a single currency is not necessarily necessary, maybe we don't have to say that, maybe it sounds a little negative and you are right, if we have irrevocably fixed exchange rates by definition we have a single currency.

Then there is a last sentence which we should not forget and it said: ""But it was also felt that such a declaration - this is different to the previous text - might better be left for a time considerably closer to the birth of the common currency."" That makes it clear that the common currency, the future currency, is something different from the basket ECU which we use today, which is fluctuating and has all the problems, particularly if some members of the EEC are not becoming members of the ERM.","I think we have clear disagreement on this point, but this is nothing new, we know about this for ten years because we discussed this already eleven years ago when we set up the EMS.

Le 11 et 12 avril: lecture d'un rapport plus court - dix pages en moins - ça sera difficile de descendre en dessous de quarante pages à mon avis. Le 20 avril: une réunion finale à Bruxelles à 10 heures. Alors, d'ici-là, si vous pouvez avant la fin de la semaine nous envoyer nos amendements pour les trois parties et en ce qui concerne la première partie je vais la revoir moi-même en fonction de ce qui a dit M. Jaans. Ca veut dire quoi? Ca veut dire que sur l'ECU il y aura un texte plus nuancé. Deuxièmement, sur le Système Monétaire Européen il faut un passage équilibré. Troisièmement, sur le grand marché, pas de mélange entre l'analyse de faits, le triomphalisme, mais autre un texte beaucoup plus court et j'essayerais de rédiger moi-même deux pages ensuite pour reprendre ce que disait le Président Pöhl ce matin. Le mouvement serait donc: nous parlerions du Système Monétaire Européen dans des termes plus équilibrés, nous parlerions de l'acte unique et du programme sur le marché intérieur, nous dirions ce qu'il y a encore à faire, et là je reprendrais les thèmes développés par le Président Pöhl ce matin en une page/une page et demie. Nous n'avons pas terminé notre tâche dans le cadre actuel puisque toutes les monnaies ne participent pas aux mécanisme de change, et cela serait souhaitable, d'autres ne participent pas à 100%, et ce serait souhaitable, la libéralisation des mouvements de capitaux va intervenir et dans le fond nous essayons de rapprocher la convergence de nos économies avec comme objectif essentiel pour cette réflexion la stabilité des prix. Donc essayons de terminer comme cela et ensuite de dire que conformément à notre mandat nous décrivons le stage final avant de revenir - mais je vous propose après la conversation que nous avons eu juste après le déjeuner de garder le ""momentum"" actuel du rapport: une première partie plus sobre, une deuxième partie sur le ""final stage"" et une troisième partie qui décrira les stages 1, 2 et 3 en tenant compte des importantes remarques que vous avez fait et bien sûr il y a 2 ou 3 points très difficile que nous mettrons en exergue d'une façon ou d'une autre, de façon à ce que vous puissiez réfléchir et nous verrons si le 12 et 13 avril nous pouvons oui ou non avoir un accord. Mais vous seriez très gentil si vous envoyiez tous vos amendements avant la fin de la semaine, ici à M. Baer à la BRI, ce qui nous permettra aussi de reprendre connaissance de toutes vos observations. Mais je vous propose, pour qu'il n'y ait pas de tromperie, de garder le mouvement actuel des trois parties. Simplement le stage 1 sera un peu plus détaché des autres et je vous propose de mettre à la fin la rédaction de M. Duisenberg sur les aspects proprement institutionnels.","I agree. I just wanted to have your agreement on the overall method. On 11 and 12 April: reading a short report - ten pages in less - it will be difficult to go below forty pages in my opinion. April 20: a final meeting in Brussels at 10 am. So until then, if you can before the end of the week we send our amendments to the three parties regarding the first part I'll see myself in terms of what has said JAANS . What does it mean? This means that the ECU there will be a more balanced text. Second, the European Monetary System requires a balanced way. Third, the big market, no mixing between facts of analysis, triumphalism, but another text much shorter and I would try to write myself then two pages to regain what was said by President Pöhl this morning. The movement would be: we would speak of the European Monetary System in more balanced terms, we would talk about the unique act of the program and on the domestic market, we would say that there is still to do, and then I would resume the themes developed by President Pöhl this morning in one page / one and a half. We have not completed our task in the current framework since all the currencies not participating in the exchange rate mechanism, and it would be desirable, others not involved 100%, and it would be desirable, the liberalization of capital movements will intervene and in the background we try to bring convergence of our economies with the primary purpose for this reflection of price stability. So try to finish like this and then to say that in accordance with our mandate we describe the final stage before returning - but I offers after the conversation we had just after lunch to keep the ""momentum"" present the report: a first sober part, a second part of the ""internship final"" and a third part that will describe the stages 1, 2 and 3 taking into account the important points you made and of course there are 2 or 3 points very difficult we will highlight one way or another, so you can think about and see if the April 12 and 13 we can or not have a deal. But you would be very nice if you sent all your amendments before the end of the week, by Baer in the BIS, which will also allow us to take knowledge of all your observations. But I propose, so that there is no deception, to keep the current movement of the three parties. Simply the Stage 1 will be a little detached from the others and I'll proposes to end the drafting of Mr Duisenberg on proper institutional aspects."

Est-ce-que je peux considérer que ce point d'analyse est juste ou non? Le Gouverneur de Larosière a proposé une phase 1 plus engagée que ce qui a été retenu et lorsqu'il a accepté que ça ne soit pas le coeur de notre proposition, il a dit, et d'autres avec lui, j'accepte la phase 1 à condition qu'en même temps il y ait un engagement d'un processus et il a dit même l'engagement de faire un traité. Est-ce-que ça reste bien ça, votre base d'accord? C'est très important ça. C'était ça qui a noué la discussion et nous a permis de progresser, alors si on n'est plus d'accord là-dessus je ne sais plus où on va. On peut acter que des points de vues différents avec toutes les nuances de vos pensés, donc c'était ça. Vous retrouverez dans la troisième partie à un moment donné ou dans la fin l'idée selon laquelle la phase 1 engage un processus qui implique la rédaction d'un traité - ce qu'a dit M. Jaans ce matin pour être moins brutal. Nous sommes d'accord là-dessus, sinon vous m’annoncez tout de suite que le rapport ne sera pas remis fin avril. Mais c'était le point qui avait fait l'objet d'une longue discussion et si vous êtes d'accord nous reprendrons ce point mais sous la formulation de M. Jaans - c'est que la phase 1 est le début d'un processus mais que ce processus doit marquer une volonté politique et aboutira à la rédaction d'un traité, à l'adoption d'un traité ou d'un amendement du Traité de Rome, peu importe. Si vous êtes d'accord sur ce point je crois que nous avons levé une grande difficulté qui a été présente aujourd'hui toute au long de la discussion de ce matin et nous pouvons sur cette base-là rédiger sans vous donner l'impression que nous ne vous avons pas compris. Est-ce-que nous pouvons le faire sur cette base, c'est ça la question? Ensuite si la terminologie est plus ou moins bonne, mais c'est bien cela que j'ai entendu.","The Committee anyway worked previous sessions. Is it-I can consider that this analysis is right or not? Governor de Larosiere has proposed a phase 1 more committed than has been selected and when it accepted that it is not the heart of our proposal, he said, and others with him, I accept Phase 1 provided at the same time there is a commitment to a process and he said the same commitment to a treaty. Do-it remains that, your basic right? It is very important that. That was who established the discussion and allowed us to grow, so if we no longer agree on it I do not know where we are going. We can state that different points of view with all the nuances of your thought, so that was it. You will find in the third part at one time or in the end the idea that Phase 1 commits a process that involves the drafting of a treaty - what Mr. JAANS this morning to be less brutal. We agree on this, otherwise you just inform me immediately that the report will not be released in late April. But that was the point that was the subject of a long discussion and if you agree we will take this point but in the formulation of Mr. JAANS - is that phase 1 is the beginning of a process but that process must score political will and lead to the drafting of a treaty, the adoption of a treaty or an amendment of the Treaty of Rome, whatever. If you agree on this point I think we raised a great difficulty that was present today all throughout the discussion this morning and we can on this basis, then write without giving you the impression that we did not understand. Is-that we can do on this basis, that's the question? Then if the terminology is more or less good, but that's what I heard."

What will we suggest? Will we suggest, as Jacques has proposed, to start negotiations on a legal text immediately on the basis of our Report? That is one alternative, or are we of the opinion as a group that that would be premature, that we should leave that - as Robin has suggested in his proposal - to the development, that we should aim first for more progress and convergence in the real economy and then in due time, when the time is ripe or right, we start this process of negotiation, the legal thing. These are the two extremes I would say. Firstly, let me say, Mr. Chairman, I am very glad that after the very natural struggles which we have had, we reached a text yesterday and in our last meeting which I think is very very co-operative. I read it, as you all did, and I think it is a good text now apart from some little drafting points (what we concluded yesterday). It would be very desirable after having reached such a high degree of agreement in very substantial points, if we could come out of this room today, if possible, also with an agreed text. I really think we should aim for some compromise between these two extreme positions. Of course, if we can't we always have the possibility of telling the world that we disagree on the follow-up and further procedures and that we describe two alternatives, but that would be the second-best solution. The best solution would be, of course, a compromise and I wonder whether the compromise could be a little bit on the lines suggested by Wim - but maybe we could redraft that. The compromise in substance could be that we say we suggest that preparatory work for a legal Treaty should be started immediately - coming a little bit in the way of Jacques - and in the competent bodies of the Community. I think that is going to happen anyway because the Monetary Committee and ECOFIN will all read the text and work on that and if we suggest that they should continue and that, for instance, there should be a working party of the Committee of Governors to deal with details of this Report, etc., and the same in the Monetary Committee, I think that would be appropriate. We can't say nothing should happen, here is our Report and that is it, the rest we leave to you. That would not be good, anyway, because then we would give the whole thing to the politicians and we would lose all control of this process. Then we say after this preparatory work - and we leave it open when that would be - if the first stage has been implemented, which will also take time, of course, and this preparatory work will take a long time I am afraid, and then at one point there should be negotiations.

I do not accept being positioned in an extremist position here and I will explain why. Indeed, I do consider that the time has now come to start the process of negotiating a Treaty and that part, of course, will comprise a preparatory sub-part, but that is not an extreme position. We have been asked to deliver, to provide, to the Heads of State concrete stages or steps for the creation of an economic and monetary union. The first stage that we have put forward is a soft stage and that was not my view, as you know. I thought we had to embark on something more significant at the very beginning. I am making compromises all day and we do this for the soft stage. But I insist very much, and if I am the only one to say this then I will be happy to say it alone, that since we are going the soft first stage way and not doing something that could have been done - pooling of reserves and very concrete manifestations of our interest in this endeavour - it is very important and essential to me, and I think to others here, to show that something is happening, that there is an impulse, some dynamism that has been put in the whole process. This impulse can only come from the launching of a process that is going to change in the future the institutional structure of all this - if we agree, of course, to do this. It is vital for me, and it is not the manifestation of an extreme position, that the softness of the first stage be in a way offset by the indication that now is the time to launch a process of negotiation. I would accept that that process of negotiation will take time, Karl-Otto, I can accept that it has to be prepared on a technical level, but the launching of the process is something that is very important. We had a long discussion last time on the importance of a signal and Alexandre made proposals on that; I thought we had agreed on the basic idea. My difficulty is not, Mr. Chairman, to concentrate the discussion on the timing of this launching of the negotiations, etc. at the end, and you know I am a very easy person to deal with, if you want to do it at the end I will be absolutely happy, but with respect to Wim there is something other than procedure in the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 41 and that something else is for me very important. It is the notion that if you want to lend credibility to this extremely soft first stage - let us be honest amongst ourselves, there is nothing really important in that first stage - we must indicate that some firm commitment for the creation of the whole process has to be given and that signal I think is, indeed, very important. That is my view.","May I say something to answer what Karl-Otto said a moment ago. I do not accept being positioned in an extremist position here and I will explain why. Indeed, I do consider that the time has now come to start the process of negotiating a Treaty and that part, of course, will comprise a preparatory sub-part, but that is not an extreme position. We have been asked to deliver, to provide, to the Heads of State concrete stages or steps for the creation of an economic and monetary union. The first stage that we have put forward is a soft stage and that was not my view, as you know. I thought we had to embark on something more significant at the very beginning. I am making compromises all day and we do this for the soft stage. But I insist very much, and if I am the only one to say this then I will be happy to say it alone, that since we are going the soft first stage way and not doing something that could have been done - pooling of reserves and very concrete manifestations of our interest in this endeavour - it is very important and essential to me, and I think to others here, to show that something is happening, that there is an impulse, some dynamism that has been put in the whole process.

I have one point of method and one of substance. The point of method is that I cannot accept postponing this part, but if we discuss the final part together otherwise it would be unacceptable. Second point: I share many of the views expressed by Governor de Larosière that we have to give strength to our Report as far as this important part is concerned, putting in something which is a message, to give some specific commitment. Of course, it is not a matter of time because it takes time but we have to stress it in a very clear way.

What does it mean to give a signal? To what? If we ask too much from the Governments and Parliaments in Europe, there is a very great risk that this Report will have the same fate as the Werner Report, because then the failure of the whole thing is already embedded, if we ask too much. We are all aware what the positions of the Governments are in Europe. We need unanimous support in the Council for a new Treaty, to start a Treaty, as long as it is in the framework of the EEC. So all Heads of State and Government have to agree and if we ask too much I think it is very clear that there will be no agreement and then the whole thing will be finished for the time being, and we will not even enter into stage one, because it is said that a clear commitment to start negotiations immediately on a new Treaty is a precondition for stage one as well. I am not sure whether that is really a very wise position.

On the other hand, I think the language of the first paragraph of paragraph 41 is something that all of us can subscribe to, that we say: ""the Committee agreed that the creation of economic and monetary union must be viewed as a single process. Although set out in stages which guide the progressive movement to the final objective, the decision to enter the first stage should be a decision to embark on the entire process"". That is a very far-reaching statement and I haven't heard any objections to that yet. The next sentence I would strongly urge you to delete because we cannot say the implementation of the concrete measures proposed for stage one should be supported by the conclusion of a new Treaty. Who knows what is going to happen. Of course, if we finish stage one we will go to stage two and that implies a Treaty, but I don't think that this is a very reasonable sentence. The second part of the paragraph I think goes much too far: “indispensable preconditions"". I mean ""a firm political commitment to the creation of economic and monetary union would appear to be an indispensable precondition for lending credibility"". In substance it is correct, but the expression is so dramatic and in my view this is not really the main problem. I think that Robin's text is much better and fits much better into reality. It says the most important precondition for reaching stage two is that we finalise stage one, and stage one means that all member states participate, that we have a higher degree of convergence. How can we talk about the Treaty, about the monetary union and the European Central Bank as long as almost half of the membership of the EC is either not willing or not able to participate in the existing institutional system? The EMS: almost half of the membership, including Italy which has now for ten years relied on a broader margin for reasons we all know, that means that five countries, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and the UK do not participate in the EMS and as long as this is the case it makes no sense at all to talk about a monetary union, at least not a European monetary union. Then it may be a monetary union between France and Germany, including Holland, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, but this is not a European monetary union. I think Robin's language is much better, much more realistic. Maybe with the exception of the last sentence where he is a little vague and which maybe could be strengthened. It has much more to do with reality than this strong call for negotiations on a monetary union.","I'm sorry, I am not sure that I fully understood what you said, but I have strong objections to accepting this wording, this language, because, Mr. Chairman, it has been said again and again that the Heads of State and Government, and even we, are asked to give a signal, I am not sure whether that is really appropriate or reasonable.

8,4/12/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",927,The Rt. Hon. Robin Leigh-Pemberton,Robin Leigh-Pemberton,534 - 625,534,625,92,,,,EN,"May I start, Mr. Chairman, on what I think is a logical consequence of what we have put in stage one and stage two. The elements in stage one can be carried out without Treaty change, they are not negligible, as Jacques de Larosière says, they are concomitant to ... I have started a very important contribution and I would be obliged if you would sit down and listen. I shall start again. The logic of what we have set out in stage one and stage two seems to me to be this: what is in stage one can be carried out without Treaty change. I don't agree with Jacques de Larosière that what is in stage one is insignificant, it represents a considerable move forward from the present position in which we are to the completion of the single market and all the consequences that are going to flow from that. This does not require a Treaty change. At some stage when we are satisfied that all the things in stage one, and I suggest the implementation of the single market, are firmly established, it will become clear that the European Community is probably convergent enough and strong enough to move to stage two. That we all acknowledge requires Treaty change. It seems to me to follow from that, therefore, the relevance of Treaty change is the moment when we go from stage one to stage two. It is perfectly clear that before we get to the end of stage one work will have to begin on the preparation of a Treaty, but I do not think that that is the same thing as saying that work should start now on the Treaty as a means of accelerating the process of stage one or the arrival of stage two, because I think that both stage one and stage two are what one might call real states of affairs on the ground which are not going to be accelerated by either institutional change or people working on Treaties. The argument for immediate work on Treaty change seems to me to stem from the need to give a political signal.

Firstly, I think we ought to be clear in our minds who we are to give a political signal. We have been asked to study steps and proposals towards economic and monetary union, does that include a requirement to make a judgement about a political signal and what the Heads of State are to do? I think not.

Secondly, even if we wished to give or suggest a political signal in the shape of Treaty change, let me say quite frankly we are not going to get it. It requires the unanimous vote of the Heads of State and I can tell you that that vote will not be unanimous, certainly over a period of years which is probably commensurate with stage one.

So I suggest that it is impractical and unhelpful to what we are trying to do to try to obtain a signal when we shall not obtain it and, indeed, I think that there is a risk that what we want to do in stage one may even be set back if we try to get something and it doesn't materialise. The other thing about the signal, the political value of immediate Treaty change, is I would like to suggest against a rather unreal background. This is exactly what K.-O. Pöhl has just said. It is against a background when the countries in the Community are at various different stages. That is why in my paragraph I have suggested that the clearest demonstration of political commitment here, surely, is a signal which could be a real one, which could be implemented - the sort of things like much better co-ordinated implementation of economic policy, the full participation of member states in the EMS - I am absolutely committed to that, I think it is essential. Can we get the idea that those practical things are secured and then once they are secured I regard it as perfectly correct that we should think about Treaty change. It is under the background of that sort of philosophy that I have drafted this paragraph. I would be ready to accept some degree of redrafting, maybe of the last sentence, because it perhaps doesn't convey quite as strongly what we would want to say, but I do want to insist on something in that last sentence: that the move towards Treaty change should not be until we can clearly see stage two over the horizon from where we are standing. I don't think we can see that at the moment. That is the background of my stance, Mr. Chairman, and in those circumstances I am afraid that I would wish to ask for the exclusion in paragraph 41 of the last sentence of the first paragraph and the whole of the second sub-paragraph, because I think that the second sub-paragraph, although it speaks of the firm political commitment, goes too far. The question that is new this morning is whether what I am arguing for and, indeed, if I may put it in the extreme what J. de Larosière and others are arguing for, can actually be met if we accept the formula of the ... and the Duisenberg paragraphs 66-70. I think that this would be possible and may I be taken as not totally committing myself to this, but I do think that that is a possible way of resolving the impasse in which we find ourselves. If I may say so, I think it is absolutely essential that we discuss the substance of this matter now, Mr. Chairman, we are doing it anyway, and once we have discussed it under paragraph 41 the chances are that we will also have completed it under paragraphs 66-70.

It will depend on the kind of conclusion that is arrived at about where we are going in the future.

It would make progress, it is very likely that very soon the peseta could be in the ERM. On the other hand, I want to remind you of the discussion that we had at the beginning and the discussion that we had even in the Committee of Governors, where it was explained to us very clearly that for legal reasons it would be impossible really to change the nature of co-ordination in the Committee of Governors because there are legal obstacles to overcome. It is because of that that we thought it would be necessary to change the Treaty. At least the message by the highest political authority that the Treaty was going to be changed, and I suppose that we will allow for certain central banks to be in a different position at the moment of the discussion on monetary co-ordination, otherwise I am afraid that stage one will be just a continuation, as Mr. Godeaux said, of the actual situation. It was explained to us that it would not be possible to go further even if personally the representative of the central bank who liked the legal situation as such that we cannot make any progress in that field. Finally, of course, there is this political situation that maybe it is impossible for political reasons to make in important step and that our Report finishes like the Werner Report. Well, if there is not a political condition this Report should finish like the Werner Report because it is not possible to change it. I think it is much better to be clear on that point, maybe it is impossible to make any progress, not just to give the impression to the Public that we are going to change certain things, which in fact we know we are not going to because there is no political agreement. It doesn't depend on us, but I do not think that we should collaborate to give the wrong signals to the public opinion on that field.","Very briefly. I completely understand the remarks about the actual situation of the EMS and the fact that many countries are not members of the ERM, but I insist on a certain point because I think it is very important for this membership what happens in this Report and what happens in future decisions. I think I can say here in confidence that the decision of the Spanish Government will depend on the result of the discussion we are having now and maybe the Spanish Government is prepared to take a very clear decision. It will depend on the kind of conclusion that is arrived at about where we are going in the future. Then with respect to the question of membership, Spain I think is very clear and I do not think that there can be an objection to the fact that the peseta is not now in the agreement because the ... is just completely the opposite.

Jaans,Pierre Jaans,672 - 703,672,703,31,,,,EN,"When looking at the present draft of the Report, one thing which is striking is that the EMS is only mentioned in the initial version as something which had weaknesses, something the potential of which has not been fully used. We have lived ten years with the EMS and writing a Report on progress towards economic and monetary union and talking about something which would be so much more constraining while the EMS is still incomplete, would I think not be very realistic on our part. Therefore, the suggestion to complete the EMS first and to have that as a strong, not only a single, move towards economic and monetary union seems to me a quite adequate move, and therefore, in terms of the proposal by Governor Leigh-Pemberton, it fits my view rather well.

With regard to timing and the question of whether to embark now on a new Treaty or to embark now on preparatory work, I think we should be aware that we are not particular experts on economic union, we are not particular experts on designing out what Ministers of Finance could in the budgetary and fiscal field see as useful co-ordination procedures, so definitely what we write in this Report are indications, but I think that the Ministers and adequate working groups of the Ministers should go in depth on that point. Therefore it would also seem to me premature to say let's start on a negotiation immediately. We should suggest to prepare a negotiation. My concern is that this Report should be realistic and build on what we have at present and not, so to say, indicate what the Werner Report did at a time when the Community had six members, well, we do not give a timetable, but to be overprecise about certain things.

8,4/12/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",931,Mr. N. Thygesen,Niels Thygesen,704 - 741,704,741,37,,,,EN,"I would advance three arguments in favour of advocating a Treaty change immediately, as Governor de Larosière has done, in addition to those of giving a signal. The first is that we have discovered in our discussion of the present EMS that the scope for intensifying co-ordination significantly beyond what exists today is very limited. That was a result of the inquiry suggested by Governor Hoffmeyer. In order to make a qualitative improvement in the EMS, it is necessary to have a Treaty change.

The second point is that I think it is unfortunate that some members of the Committee seem to regard comprehensive membership of the present EMS as a substitute, an equally strong signal, as a Treaty change. Let me put it a bit bluntly, and I apologise to Governor Leigh-Pemberton because some of the remarks are directed at the UK. If we look at what happens in the UK we see that monetary policy is oriented very much towards domestic concerns, volatility of interest rates and exchange rates have increased if anything, that decision-making on interest rates is highly politicised; these are factors that would within the framework of the present EMS destabilise the system rather than improve it. I think it is a somewhat facetious argument to say that comprehensive membership is an essential improvement of the EMS. Something stronger is required to accommodate a member such as the UK: a system where there is no doubt that there is an element of collective monetary policy.

My third point is that the UK authorities have in a number of statements, and you also Governor Leigh-Pemberton, said that EMU is not on the agenda at an early time and have over-emphasised in a sense the impossibility of having any form of independent policy within an EMU. (Leigh-Pemberton: full EMU) I think that this Committee is answering some of your concerns in other parts of the Report, notably in Part II that we discussed yesterday, and we need also for that reason to reiterate that EMU is the aim and to do so at an early stage.

Finally, I would just like to note that, in contrast to what Governor Pöhl says, a decision to convene a conference to discuss a Treaty change is not a matter for unanimous decision but a matter for a simple majority in the European Council, as we saw in the case of the Single Act.","I would advance three arguments in favour of advocating a Treaty change immediately, as Governor de Larosière has done, in addition to those of giving a signal.

It is clear where my position is, but I think that one should be aware of the fact that we all agree that one should tell the Heads of State that if they want to realise an economic and monetary union there should be a decision to embark on the entire process. This is the fundamental issue and it is curious that we discuss in a sense political advice to the Heads of State much more than this essential thing. That is as if we were Secretaries of the Heads of State, telling them you should give a signal and one signal is more important than the other. Do you really think that a signal, when you look at all the statements and communiqués that have been published during the years, do you really think that a statement by the Heads of State which is clearly unrealistic would be a better signal than, for instance, if the Heads of State said now we engage on this process and we embark on the entire process, and to show our goodwill we all join the present applications? Wouldn't you expect this to be a much stronger signal than to say we embark now on a Treaty negotiation which, well, when would it last? Do you really think that people will attach much importance to that? It is a question of being a secretary to a political authority. Then I think that one could imagine that you could say well, you will have to choose yourself, you are politicians so you will find the best signal. There are these various things and that would be a compromise. But the essence is that there you have to embark on the whole process if you want to realise it.","

8,4/12/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",933,M. A. Lamfalussy,Alexandre Lamfalussy,773 - 850,773,850,77,,,,EN,"I would like to make a few points and perhaps talk a little longer than I usually do. The first point I would like to make is about the way I tried to draft this second sub-paragraph, which is at the centre of the discussion. When I put that to you in one of our last meetings this was done already in a spirit of compromise, the compromise comes out in the way it is drafted, and I did it rather carefully not to make it prescriptive. It is a descriptive statement. It may be strong in some of the words, one can change that, but it is a descriptive statement which of course sets the tone but does not prescribe anything to anyone. Please read it in that sense. That is simply on the way it is drafted. Now let me come to the substance, and I must say that I don't necessarily stick to this paragraph and I am ready myself to envisage a number of alternatives, but let me talk about the substance.

What is stage one about? The only substantive point in stage one, as it stands today, is that the Committee of Governors would shift in its practice from ex post discussion of monetary policy events gradually towards an ex ante co-ordination effort of monetary policies. If you go through the text, this is the only thing that is in that stage one. (?: may I correct you, there are many other things in stage one). This is the thing that on reading it one would really retain. This is a very important thing, I am not saying that this is an unimportant thing, it is an extremely important matter and it is important in two ways. On the one hand, because it would mean that the Governors themselves would change their method of work; and secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, they would give recommendations and express views on monetary policies, which goes even further because that involves not only themselves but in most countries it involves the Governments. They would give recommendations and that is an extremely important step. I am not complaining about the lack of substance in that stage, I think it is an important change.

Here I come to my problem of credibility. Let me quite frankly tell you that I have a rather unique position in the sense that I have participated in the meetings of the Governors for ten years, so I saw it from inside and at the same time not being a member of the Committee, not being a Governor, I can look at it from outside as well, both sitting in this building and having some sort of external view on these events. If I take my external hat, but also looking at my own experience, I was sitting in that Committee at the time the EMS was discussed and I did even take a rather active part in some of the discussions, I think that the view of the external world is that if this Committee of Governors does not receive an external impulse to move in the direction which is suggested in stage one, that this move from ex post discussions towards an ex ante co-ordination of policies will not happen. It will not happen because that is not the way a group of central bankers works. When the EMS was set up, it was the result of an external political impulse and this is the more so since what you ask here is that the Governors are willing and ready to give advice to Governments on monetary policy. It is a very important step. So any outside observer who will read this Report will say, but why on earth has that not happened already? If this can be done without any external political impulse it ought to have happened already. It hasn't happened, therefore why is it going to happen? This is why I used the word credibility. I am saying this very bluntly, because I do care for the Governors as much as anyone can, and I am really interested in their own credibility and also in their own ability to perform this change, which I do not think they have unless there is an external impulse. How should that external impulse come? There I can see a number of ways and I am not doctrinaire about it in any sense and I can imagine that the way the drafting is done in Wim's proposal at the end can go quite a long way in that direction, but you need an external impulse to be credible in the implementation of stage one.

8,4/12/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",934,Mr. M. Doyle,Maurice F. Doyle,851 - 938,851,938,87,,,,EN,"I just want to clarify my own position first of all and try to make a suggestion. I find myself sharing a lot of the views both of Karl-Otto and Robin, on the one hand, when they say you cannot artificially create a political process just by writing something in a Report, and I also share the view of J. de Larosière and J. Godeaux that we cannot simply sit where we are. I would like to make two points: firstly, I think we ought to consider very carefully exactly what our role is and exactly what parity or force we can realistically regard our own Report as having, because if you step over that line you will undermine the authority of the whole Report. I think Erik Hoffmeyer put his finger on it when he said that we must not try in this Report to act as the Secretariat of the European Council.

The second point I would like to make is by way of appeal to the protagonists on both sides of this discussion, that I think both sides are falling into the trap of reading something into the texts, both their own texts and the other texts, that frankly isn't there. Could I address you for a moment on the actual text that is there. In the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 41, look at the second and third sentences, they say: ""The Committee agreed that the creation of EMU must be viewed as a single process"". It also says that ""the decision to enter the first stage should be a decision to embark on the entire process"". Now that says it all, there is nothing in the first sentence of the second sub-paragraph which says a firm political commitment to the creation of EMU would be an indispensable precondition for lending credibility to the decision to embark on the first stage. That is only saying the same thing in, as Karl-Otto said, a much more dramatic and may I suggest a much more provocative fashion, which is likely to be rejected by the European Council. The first statement in the first paragraph there says it all: it says that a decision to enter the first stage should be a decision to embark on the entire process, in other words, don't start on anything that we are setting out as being in stage one unless you intend to go to stage three, and that seems to me to be a perfectly logical and sensible thing to say to them. The reason, it seems to me, why we are in this position today is really because nobody au fonds believes, nobody in Europe really believed, what the European Council said last year, which was ""we want EMU, tell us how to get there”, I really do think that is the case. They didn't say we want EMU let everybody believe that, you are a bunch of technicians, tell us 1, 2, 3-17 how to get there. That is really why we are having all this discussion. Therefore, I think that is the purpose of this Report basically is to go back to the European Council and say: you said you wanted EMU, do you really understand what it implies and that we have set out, and says then, alright if you still want it then this is how you go about it. That to my mind is really what this Report is saying and that is why I think there is a very careful line to be drawn here in the way you address the European Council and for my money the first sub-paragraph of that I think says it gently enough and explicitly enough without being too provocative. (The Chairman: Including the last sentence?) That is the mention of the Treaty, I would prefer to ignore that at the moment, Mr. Chairman if you don't mind, because that is to one side of my point. I think the first three sentences in paragraph 41 make the whole point that is necessary in that respect.

As regards the Treaty, because I want to come to that separately, again to clarify my own position, I am stated here as supporting Governor Hoffmeyer's text on the right-hand side of the page, I have to make it clear that I support the first sentence of that, but not the second. Can I come back to texts again, if you look at Robin Leigh-Pemberton's text, the first sentence there again says no more than has been said in paragraph 41 already. It is saying it in a more elegant way and I think people are reading into it things that aren't in it, but essentially the text says no more, it is saying a clear political commitment to the final stage would lend credibility to what you are doing, but that is what the original text is saying, i.e. the decision to enter the first stage should be a decision to embark on the entire process. That is just another way of saying the same thing.

As regards the Treaty question, again I am not really sure that there is a point of substance in this at the end of the day, because a Treaty clearly is necessary to get into stage two, clearly it is going to take time to prepare a Treaty, what one needs is something that says: when you are getting towards the end of stage one, you don't only then commence considering a Treaty, you should have all that preparatory ground work out of the way so that no further time is wasted, so that when stage two can become a viable proposition you have a Treaty ready instantly to go into effect and that it doesn't become yet another excuse to waste another five years discussing a Treaty. I think that is the essential point and I really do believe that if you are too explicit, in a way that seems to be putting a gun to the head of the European Council and says that unless you stand up in public and swear that you are going to do X, Y and Z, I think that approach is counter-productive, I have to say. At the end of the day it is not going to change events.

Au moment présent nous commençons à introduire de considérations politiques dans le sens où si nous mettons dans le papier noir sur blanc trop clairement qu'il faudra un traité - et nous insistons trop sur ce point - on risque de ne pas avoir une unanimité ou on risque de bloquer le processus. Je crois qu'il y a une inconséquence parce que notre obligation de mon point de vue est de dire quelles sont les implications de la question complète et ne pas cacher des implications ou faciliter la tâche. S'il n'y a pas un accord politique, il vaut mieux savoir qu'il n'y a pas un accord politique pour faire l'union économique et monétaire. Si on ne croit pas l'affirmation du principe qu'on veut l'union économique et monétaire - et le Gouverneur Doyle disait tout à l'heure: au fonds personne n'y croit. Si ce diagnostic ... exacte et personne n'y croit à l'union économique et monétaire il vaut mieux dire clairement que les hommes politiques ou les gouvernements ne sont pas en mesure d'accepter les implications de l'union économique et monétaire, mais ne pas tricher intellectuellement de notre point de vue et cacher les implications, parce que nous avons insisté sur ce que l'union économique, l'union monétaire et les étapes sont des aspects indivisibles d'un tout. On peut faire beaucoup de choses aux étapes et on en reparlera après pour voir s'il y a une volonté politique de continuer ou non. Donc les choses ne sont pas tellement indivisibles si cette thèse est exacte, alors que nous souhaitons tout le temps qu'il y a une cohérence de tout processus. Donc ce n'est pas seulement, de mon point de vue, une question de discuter quel est le signal politique, parce que là les préférences ou les aspects que certains donnent plus d'importance à une part et d'autres à une autre part, mais en plus du signal politique qui est assez discutable il y a une question de cohérence. Si on ne veut pas atteindre le processus complet il faut dire qu'on n‘atteint pas le processus complet et qu'on fera autre chose pour avancer vers une union économique et monétaire, on s'arrangera dans les institutions existantes.

Deuxièmement, je pense que dans la valorisation de ce qui serait l'engagement le plus important il y a les deux positions. L'engagement le plus important c'est se soumettre à la discipline de changes, l'engagement le plus important c'est la négociation d'un traité qui donne la logique du processus entier. Ne serait-il pas possible de trouver une synthèse entre ces deux aspects et de dire que les pas les plus importants, ou les pas qui déclenchent le processus, c'est d'une part la préparation d'un traité? Au moment où les chefs de gouvernements considéreront qu'il faut commencer cette négociation je pense que la question du moment, de l'instant précis - et M. de Larosière l'avait dit ainsi - il ne s'agit pas de commencer le mois suivant, ni de se compromettre à la négociation d'un traité pour, comme démonstration qu'on déclenche le processus, mais est-ce-qu'on ne peut pas essayer de mettre sur un certain pied d'égalité la question de la négociation d'un traité et l'acceptation de la discipline de change par le plus grand nombre de pays et ? financier de la Communauté? Parce que sauf que cette possibilité me paraît sensée et pour trouver une synthèse entre les deux signaux ou les deux interprétations des deux signaux, sauf que la condition soit que tous les pays entrent dans la discipline de changes pour avancer dans le processus, parce qu'alors je crois que c'est l'étape ? plusieurs fois, cette position qui est extrême dans le droit de veto à n'importe quel pays ce qui est peu admissible. Mais on pourrait insister qu'un signal politique et que la logique même du processus obligent à ce que la plupart des pays ?, ou pratiquement la totalité des pays, soient prêts à accepter la discipline de change en parallèle à la négociation du traité. Je pense que cela serait plus équilibré du point de vue de ce qui est plus important - discipline de change ou négociation de traité - recommander les deux choses en parallèle.
","In the manner of reasoning, we have always tried to do our work from the viewpoint of consistency between European economic construction and the implications it has, without hiding politicians what are the consequences and implications of this construction . At the present time we are beginning to introduce political considerations in the sense that if we put in black on white paper too clearly that it will take a treaty - and we stress this enough - we may not have a unanimous or there may block the process. I think there is an inconsistency because our obligation to my point of view is to say what the implications of the full question and do not hide the implications or the convenience. If there is no political agreement, it is better to know that there is no political agreement for economic and monetary union. If one does not believe the affirmation of the principle that we want economic and monetary union - and Governor Doyle said earlier: to fund nobody believes. If this diagnosis ... accurate and nobody believes in the economic and monetary union it is better to say clearly that politicians or governments are not able to accept the implications of the economic and monetary union, but do not cheat intellectually our perspective and hide the implications, because we have stressed that the economic union, monetary union and the steps are indivisible aspects of a whole. We can do many things in steps and we'll talk about it afterwards to see if there is a political will to continue or not. So things are not so indivisible if this thesis is correct, then we wish all the time that there is a consistency of any process. So it's not just from my point of view, a question of discussing what is the political signal, because there preferences or certain aspects that give more importance to either side to the other but in addition to the political signal is rather questionable there is a question of consistency. If it does not reach the entire process must say that does not reach the entire process and we will do anything to advance towards economic and monetary union, it will work out in the existing institutions.

Secondly, I think that in the valuation of what would be the biggest commitment there are two positions. The most important commitment is to submit to the discipline of foreign exchange, the most important commitment is the negotiation of a treaty giving the logic of the whole process. Is it not possible to find a synthesis between these two aspects and to say that not the most important, or not that trigger the process is firstly the preparation of a treaty? When government leaders consider that we must begin this negotiation I think the question of the moment, the exact moment - and Mr de Larosiere had said so - it is not about to begin the month next, nor to compromise in the negotiation of a treaty, as a demonstration that triggers the process, but is it-you can not try to put on a par the issue of negotiation of a treaty and the acceptance of the exchange discipline by the largest number of countries? Financial Community? Because only this possibility seems sensible to me and to find a synthesis between the two signals or two interpretations of the two signals, but the condition is that all countries join the exchange discipline to advance the process, because "" so I think this is the step? several times, this position is extreme in the veto to any country which is not eligible. But one could insist that a political signal and that the logic of the process require that most countries? Or virtually all countries are ready to accept the exchange discipline in parallel with the negotiation of the treaty. I think it would be more balanced perspective of what is most important - Currency discipline or treaty negotiation - recommend two things in parallel.

Pöhl,Karl Otto Pöhl,997 - 1058,997,1058,61,,,,EN,"Mr. Chairman, I really don't know what the ... is here in this group, I really can't understand that because, firstly, I am not prepared to accept the argument that the external world is looking at us, that they expect us to give a signal and that we are losing credibility if we don't give the signal. We are not politicians, who are we, as Robin rightly said? We are not politicians who have to give signals and we are not losing our credibility. We are losing our credibility if we make proposals which are completely unrealistic. We are not here to compromise, we are not negotiating anything in this group, we have to express our views and if we can't agree we have to say that. I would regret that and I don't think it is necessary because I think we could agree. If we can't we have to say it, we are not in a government negotiation here. That is my first point.

The second point which I am not ready to accept is that the so-called first stage is only a soft version, or whatever has been said. There is a lot of substance in this so-called first stage, for instance, the fact that all the members of the Committee are prepared to say in public that they recommend to their respective governments that all member states of the EC should fully participate in the existing monetary arrangements. I think that is a very strong statement by a group like this, I think it is very courageous that the Governor of the Bank of England is prepared to stand to this statement in public, because everybody knows that this is not the position of the British Government. I think that is a very courageous statement. So this is not nothing and I tell you that what we have in mind - I am not sure, Alexandre, that we have really agreed an ex ante co-ordination of monetary policies, that is not in the text and I would not be able to deliver, because this would not be consistent with the existing laws in the Federal Republic of Germany which I have to obey. In the first place the laws would have to be changed in order to achieve that. We have an independent Central Bank Council which takes decisions and I am not even sure I can deliver all the things I propose, and that is why I wanted to introduce something like: we are acting in a personal capacity. I am not the only one who is in that position, there are others who are in a similar situation. This is not nothing, there are many points, many things, and the fact that we have agreed on so many substantial points: the ECU, on the structure of a future ECBS, this is a lot of agreement so I am really not ready to accept this - how should I say - to belittle these kinds of things.

My third point is that I think that everything which is asked for is really in the text. First of all we are saying - and we agree all of us - that the Community should embark on this process, as has been said in the first part of paragraph 41 and again in the second part: ""a clear political commitment to the final stage, as described in Part II, would lend credibility to the intention ..."". What more can you expect than that? This is a unanimous opinion. Then we are also suggesting that negotiations should start. Robin says that in his text, which I think is much better, it puts things in the right order and emphasises the necessity of changes in policies and not only in the legal framework. I think the changes in policies are much more important than these institutional and legal things. He also says at the end of the sentence that, given that background commitment by the political authorities, in good time before entering stage two, to enter into the negotiation of a new Treaty would have added significance. So we are suggesting negotiations but, of course, after appropriate preparation. In paragraph 68 we are saying these proposals should contain a further elaboration and concretisation, of course they should, we have not invented the ? here, in the competent bodies and they should serve as the basis for future negotiations on a revised Treaty in an intergovernmental conference to be called by the European Council. I cannot imagine any different procedure, we cannot start a conference tomorrow, we have to prepare this. There are many many open questions. So I really don't know why we are struggling here, I don't understand that. We are suggesting everything you want.

I would like, firstly, to say to Governor Doyle that I am not sure that I can follow him in his interpretation of the mandate which has been given to us. I don't think that we are mandated to tell the Heads of State and Government what the difficulties and implications are. We have to say a bit more, we have to say how we can define concrete steps and stages to get there. That brings me to stages. We say in paragraph 43: ""discrete but evolutionary steps"", so we need stages with content and apparently we disagree upon the content of stage one. I do remember from earlier discussions that many of us were not very convinced that there was a great amount of substance in stage one, and then I hear Governor Pöhl saying that ex ante co-ordination of consultation is not decided. One of the major elements that M. Lamfalussy was mentioning as a point of substance is going out, it's not there anymore. What is then the real substance of stage one? In the definition: we have given ourselves as the necessary content of a stage, so I don't agree that we can say that stage one has sufficient substance in itself to render credibility to the process we want to initiate with this first stage.

Secondly, Mr. Chairman, the Treaty is an unavoidable element already to go into stage two and we say it in our Report. Why shouldn't we say that? ... Listen, I come to the sentence you had put into brackets, the sentence: ""the implementation of the concrete measures proposed for a stage one should be supported by the conclusion of a new Treaty"". That is a precondition to go to stage one, so why not say it? If we then could say that it would also be a firm political commitment then I think we are going in the right direction.

That brings me to the force element and that is the factor of timing. We do agree that the negotiations on a revised Treaty will take, well, quite a bit of time, it is a complicated matter and lots of preparatory work has to be done. That is what you have said, what Governor Duisenberg has said, etc. What does it mean in terms of going to stage two? If we start after some years of experience with stage one in view of going to stage two, if we then start the real negotiations, in my view, we are late. There is a practical reason in my view to launching the debate, the negotiations, at an earlier stage, not only a political signal there is a practical reason as well.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, we have to look for a compromise. The two positions will not be easy to be agreed. Would it be possible to maintain the text as we have it, perhaps slightly modified, and then in that text make immediately a reference to the procedure according to the proposals of Mr. Duisenberg?

8,4/12/1989,OK,,"T, P, B",938,M. J. de Larosière,Jacques de Larosière,1104 - 1187,1104,1187,83,,,,EN,"Firstly, I would like to thank Robin for his exposition, which I thought was very fair and very clear, of a matter on which we have a rather different approach between ourselves. I think it is right to expose the reasons of our positions. I think he made it very clear that the logic, as he sees it, is to do it in an evolutionary process, to start with what he thinks are indeed the fundamentals, i.e. better co-ordinating policies, building the economic fundamental conditions for the success of the whole process, getting all the countries ""in"" and then developing on the basis of that build-up of experience, then the phase of the negotiations. That is a very respectable view, which I do not fundamentally contest as such. I want to explain in two minutes, it will be very short, why I do not agree with that presentation.

My view is this: we have been asked by the Heads of State to tell them what was the way to move into economic and monetary union and to provide the concrete stages and steps in order to do so. I think we have to answer that question and we have to answer it more precisely, perhaps in a more accelerated fashion - that is the difference between us basically - and in a more institutional fashion, I admit, than sort of describing an evolutionary process which would build on improvements, experience and then lead in the future towards this monetary union. I think I am more in the context of the question that has been posed to us by the Heads of State than in describing the sorts of evolutionary processes that Robin has been stressing. You can do it in different ways. I have suggested, but that has not been retained by the majority and it is going to be very clear in the Report that that is not a majority, that we leap into a first stage that would have been, e.g., putting together some of our reserves and building some institutional embryo of a central bank. It could have been possible and the fact that I have not been completely laughed out of court by some of you shows that we could have done a thing like that, but we didn’t want in our totality to do it. Right, so it will not be done, but it was a way of doing that. We haven't done that and we have said, let us start off on - maybe I was not very careful in saying soft process, but I think it is a language that has been used in our discussions and I had nothing pejorative in mind, you have used it - really honestly look at what is in that. I think it is, indeed, soft without pejorative, I think it is soft, I think Alexandre was wrong, there is no ex ante co-ordination - though it is not written in, the language is very careful. No, no, no. Look at page 31, it is very important to see what is said. It is said: ""you can formulate opinions on the overall orientation of monetary and exchange rate policy"", I think we can always do that and I actually believe that every month we do it, and then as well as on ""measures taken by individual countries"". So, we are kindly invited to formulate opinions on the overall orientations of what we gentlemen have decided as measures. I think this is no real advancement vis-à-vis what happens. Then this is the boldest thing: ""in particular, the Committee would be consulted in advance of national decisions on the course of monetary policy"". That is indeed the greatest advancement, but you see you are going to change it. Let us be very honest and I know you can't deliver because you have shown us, in response to Mr. Hoffmeyer's request on the legal aspects, that you couldn't do it. I am coming to my point: stage one is a very soft and modest improvement of the procedures that we have already at our disposal and it is nothing more than that. Coming back to my point, since we are not proposing something a little bit spectacular in the first stage, but the continuation with some improvement of our methods, I say that the only way we can deliver what we have been asked to do is to say, well, OK, after that stage one you can conceive of a stage two, which is then really getting your feet into this system, and of course if you want to lend some credibility to the very soft thing you do at the beginning, you have to from the outset say that you are embarking on two and three. In order to give some concrete manifestation of backing to all this process, you have to embark on a Treaty negotiation, since stage two necessitates technically a Treaty. You have to do that from the very start. I admit that some preparatory work will be needed, that I can very well conceive, and I admit that this is going to take time, and I admit that no Treaty will be done if there is no political support to do a Treaty. The whole logic of the steps that have been asked to us is to do it at least the way I say, but if you say, as Robin would like to say, let these three prior things happen - co-ordination and the full joining, etc. - then you are no more in the logic of what has been asked to us which is precise concrete steps.
